TITLE: Resolved: Man-made Global Warming Exists.

CATEGORY: Science

Global warming is significantly man man made
 
 Here is a general website that debunks anti man made global warming folks, claim by claim
  http://www.skepticalscience.com... 
 
 Here is proof that carbon dioxide has nearly doubled and increased exponentially since the industrial revolution
  http://en.wikipedia.org... 
 
 Here is a similar graph that shows temperature following a similar fate
  http://en.wikipedia.org... 
 
 Here are websites that tie together co2 and temperature, and debunks any claims about why co2 and temperature carbon are not always tightly correlated

 There's no question that temperature and CO2 is correlated. You can see that in the links i provided, historically.

 Here is that they are more than just correlated, but tied together

 Here is a graph showing the thickness of polar caps melting exponentially

 Here is a scientific article that refers to the ice caps being doomed

 Warming not caused by volcanoes and the Sun cycles
 
 --------------
 'The volcano theorists can't even keep their stories straight. In his book, Limbaugh claims that the 1991 Pinatubo eruption put 1000 times as much chlorine into the atmosphere as industry has ever produced through CFCs; yet on Nightline, Pinatubo is alleged to have produced 570 times the equivalent of one year's worth of CFCs. Both can't be right. It turns out neither are.
 The figure 570 apparently derives from Ray's book--but she said it was Mount Augustine, an Alaskan volcano that erupted in 1976, that put out 570 times as much chlorine as one year's worth of CFCs. Ray's source is a 1980 Science magazine article--but that piece was actually talking about the chlorine produced by a gigantic eruption that occurred 700,000 years ago in California (Science, 6/11/93).'
 '---------
 I'd also add, that the common sense answer to me is... consider all the smoke stacks out there. Consider all the pollution, places like LA. I'd bet California itself is like a volcano very short period in intervals. doesn't this make the most sense, considering how little and how infrequent volcanoes erupt?

 QUOTE
 With respect to global warming, though solar activity has been at relatively high levels during the recent period, the fact that solar activity has been near constant during the last 30 years precludes solar variability from playing a large role in recent warming. It is estimated that the residual effects of the prolonged high solar activity account for between 18 and 36% of warming from 1950 to 1999

 So:
 -We rule out major causes like the sun and earth's rotation
 -Our north pole just melted completely a few years ago. this is a historic event that doesn't occur very often at all.
 -If we look at ice levels in polar regions... we can see carbon and darker ice during the industrial revolution... and it's noticeably lighter at the point the clean air act was introduced... this is simply evidence, but tangible evidence that this stuff is in not only the sky but everywhere.
 -If we look at temperature increases... yes, it shows we are getting hotter. We are setting records at a more frequent basis.
 -If we look at natural temperature increases... we see we've been increasing for thousands of years. But, we see that it's been accelerating in recent history, particularly the industrial revolution where pollution occurs. This is in reference to the infamous "hockey stick" graph. No, we can't deduce from that alone that we're the cause, but we can give it as supporting the fact that there's an accelerated increase, especially at our time.
 -Studies have been done that show CO2 being a cause of warming. we might squabble about how much warming, but we know it causes some.
