TITLE: The Christian God does exist. Christ is not a religion but, a reality!

CATEGORY: Science

After looking through Pro's round, I found zero arguments. At a stretch, he might have made two points.
 1. The bible supports the Christian reality.
 My refutation is that Pro has given no reason as to why the Bible is reliable.
 2. Islam and other religions are bad.
 This is irrelevant to the resolution at hand.
 
 Pro has the full BoP here and has yet to produce any arguments, so as of this moment I am winning. I will give the problem of evil this round just for the heck of it.
    The Problem of Evil     This is an argument againt the standard omnipotent omniscient and omnibenevolent Christian god.
       1.  If an omniscient, omnipotent, and omnibenevolent god existed, gratuitous suffering would not exist.      2.  Gratuitous suffering exists.     3. An omniscient, omnipotent, and omnibenevolent god does not exist.    Defense of 1: A completely loving and good being would be willing to end all evil if possible. An omnipotent being would be capable of doing it. Therefore an omnipotent and omnibenevolent god does not exist.    Defense of 2: This one is obvious. Natural disasters, starving children in Africa, animals receiving inhumane treatment are all examples of unnecessary suffering.        “William L. Rowe's famous example of natural evil: ‘In some distant forest lightning strikes a dead tree, resulting in a forest fire. In the fire a fawn is trapped, horribly burned, and lies in terrible agony for several days before death relieves its suffering.’”    ( http://en.wikipedia.org... ...)      Point 3 is supported and the resolution is negated.
