TITLE: Watch the 28 minute movie silent scream. Abortion is immoral.

CATEGORY: Politics

Everyone deserves a chance at life. Putting your social life above your baby is cruel. The right to life overrides control over your body in my opinion. I don't want to force my opinion on others so I'm not suggesting that elective abortion become illegal.
 The diary of an unborn child.
 Mommy. I'm 6 days old. I'm connecting my self to your uterus,my home.
 Im 22 days old now. My heart is beating and carrying my own blood.
 I'm now 3 weeks old. My spinal column and nervous system are forming. My liver and kidneys are taking shape.
 I'm 5 weeks old. My hands, eyes and legs are developing.
 Week 6! I have a mouth and lips and my fingernails are forming
 I'm now 7 weeks old. My eyelids, toes and nose are distinct. I'm kicking and squirming now!.
 Week 8. I'm a big girl now mommy! I can't wait to do fun things with you! My organs are in place and my bones are replacing my cartilage. I have finger prints now. I can hear too.
 Week 10. I heard you talking to your friend. You didn't seem to happy. You found out i was living in you. We can make it work.
 But hey I can breath amniotic fluid and urinate. I can grasp things and my organs work. I love you mommy.
 Week 12 my nerves and spinal cord are complete. You went to the doctor. He seemed mean. I didn't like his home. Planned parenthood seems mean. I like my cozy cottage in your uterus.
 Mommy your back at the doctor. I'm feeling scared. What's going on.
 What's that. The canula is invading my home. Get it out. No! It hurts! Mommy please.
 I'm in heaven now. Why didn't you want me
