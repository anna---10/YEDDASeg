TITLE: Same sex marriage

CATEGORY: Politics

Let's say that the world was completely different and it was normal to be gay but not normal to be straight but you like a girl anyway would you want everyone hating on you because of it? I think if someone wants to have a marriage to who they love then they should be aloud to. I don't however think they should be aloud to display public "love" ex. Kissing. I think that they should still keep it private because some people might not want to see that. Don't tell someone they can't do something they want to do because they will do it anyway.
