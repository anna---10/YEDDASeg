TITLE: Absolute right to gun ownership

CATEGORY: Politics

First of all, 8.3% of our population are felons, {1} so even if just anyone could get a gun with the absolute right to gun ownership, then there would be about 11 times as many armed law abiding citizens as there would be armed felons. Now, if someone tries to bring an AK-47 into a school, chances are someone is going to see him pulling a giant semi-automatic gun out of his car, this would allow the people inside the school to prepare and arm, they would also be better at defending the school since they are familiar with their surroundings and would also be garrisoned inside. 
 
 Second of all, 'tyrannical government' usually refers to our own government, not some foreign invading government. And the UN is actually one of the things that we would have to defend our nation against. 
 
 Third of all, if you're going up against a gang of 7, 8 people, then you'll never regret having too much ammunition. If the military has semi-automatics then we the people need semi-automatics, it's that simple, the people should always be armed at least to an equal extent that the government is.
