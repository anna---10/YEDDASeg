TITLE: Trump would make a good president from an economic point of view.

CATEGORY: Economics

Alrighty then. 
 
    Trade: 
 
    " Let us not forget that Donald Trump started with a million dollars and he turned that into an international multi-billion dollar economic empire. He has published several books on the economy and on global trade. I think it is unwise to call such a man ignorant on global trade due to his accomplishments, his books and his grand international economic empire." 
 
 I recognize this but this is an appeal to authority. And secondly, he is a business man. His experience with any kind of economics is on the micro scale, not the macro. And as I've shown in my previous segment his ignorance of the macro-economical impact of trade is evident in his rhetoric. 
 
  " That's why I support repealing current free trade agreements until the US manufacturing sector returns to its former glory."
 
 It's not coming back. As I've shown in the second graph manufacturing jobs have been going down for a long time. Long before any significant free trade deal was enacted. 
 
 Let's look at this graph to corroborate my claim.
 
   
 
 As we can see here, productivity has increased with output in the U.S but employment in manufacturing has declined with it. The only way this can be possible is if manufacturing jobs have been replaced by more efficient capital along with technological advancement. In this case, with or without free trade manufacturing job's will go down regardless as job's in manufacturing are becoming more easily and more cheaply automated.
 
    Trade deficit 
       
      Trade deficits are not necessarily a bad thing and they are certainly not a sign of unfair trade. When Americans buy imports, the foreigners must use the dollars they earn on something. They can either buy American exports or invest in American assets.
 
 If the amount of investments entering the U.S exceeds the amount going out, the extra dollars entering the U.S can be used by Americans to buy imports at an amount above the U.S could buy by just selling American exports. As the CATO institute says on this subject: "A  current account deficit is simply the mirror image of a capital account surplus." [1]
 
 Also, trade deficits are great indicators of consumer confidence in the market. If they weren't buying the goods imported demand would have fallen along with imports. If citizens are forced to purchase more expensive, domestic products they may just not purchase the goods at all if the opportunity cost is too high. 
 
 " " Yes, domestic jobs go " I appreciate your honesty con"
 
  This is not me conceding this point. As I've stated before, when it comes to trade and job loss it's never really a "loss". When consumers are able to purchase goods from abroad cheaper, they now have a surplus of money they can spend which can be spent on domestic goods and services. 
 
 Accord to the U.S Chamber of Commerce, Increased trade from NAFTA supports 5 million U.S jobs and unemployment went down from 7.1% to 5.1% from 1994 to 2007 only increasing from 2008 to 2012 after the stock market crash. [2]
 
 
    Taxes and Debt
 
    " Trump does have a plan to cut spending. He plans to cut spending into some social programs not including cuts to Medicare nor education nor social service. But cuts to programs that do not work like obamacare"  
 
 Obamacare was NOT a useless program. It lowered health care costs for one. in 2015 costs only rose by 0.5% as opposed to the usual annual increase of 3% or 4%. It also lowers the budget deficit by $143 billion over the next 10 years by reducing health care costs and transfers the costs to pharma companies and health care providers who are constantly getting stupid rich from absurd health care costs. [3] 
 
 His good ol' "let the markets lower prices" rhetoric has been empirically disproved over and over again. Monopolies just form as they have in the u.s and providers collectively raise prices and Trump has no specific plan for this problem. [4]
 
 " but that estimation does not include the fact that Donald Trump will not be paying for the wall between America and Mexico"
 
  Mexico has already stated they will not pay for any wall. [5] And even if he did build the wall for free and fully maintained that wall it would only cost around $25 billion at most. [6] This still leaves him with an $11.975 trillion deficit. Weather the wall is paid for or not by someone else that's a drop in the bucket compared to what his actual calculated deficit will be.
 
 I shall await your rebuttal.
