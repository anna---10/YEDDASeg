TITLE: Poor people are Far better off than rich people

CATEGORY: Society

I guess i was talking about how money can destroy peoples lives, rape the forest, and do all kinds of damage on its way to the table. Large amounts of cash do not make people happy. Majority rules when one is looking for facts. I have done countless searches on the net, and come to find that modesty is the best way to go! And since i felt this way before my search, i was not influenced in any which way. So if the voter can agree that we silly naked humans, would be better off with only the things we need, like food, clothes, Eco friendly housing, and a vacation every now and then, that would mean i win! If not you win! But this is just a fun round for me anyway! As I go I will think of clearer, and way cleaner topics.
