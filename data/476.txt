TITLE: Gun control is unconstitutional

CATEGORY: Politics

The second amendment very clearly states "the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed." By implementing gun control, we are infringing the rights to bear arms, and therefore, we are implementing an unconstitutional law.
 
 Con can go first.
