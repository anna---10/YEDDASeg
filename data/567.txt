TITLE: Organizations Can Ethically Inhibit the Free Speech of Their Members

CATEGORY: Society

Government is something that everyone has to participate in, and by your definition of organization is not included in this discussion. Those people still have the freedom of speech just not as much as we do. That is not  ethically  right though. Do you think that its ethically right for the Islamic government to kill anyone who ridicules or doesn't obey the Quran? No. That is not ethically right.
 
 Back to organizations, there is no time an organization to ethically inhibit their freedom of speech. When a person criticizes the company they work for, should they be fired? I don't think so. The company should learn from what that person says, take it into consideration, and then improve their company. They should talk to that person and try to fix the solution, not fire them on the spot. It's not ethical to fire a person because they criticized the company.
