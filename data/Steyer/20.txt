TITLE: Reciprocity of conceal carry permits.

CATEGORY: Politics

um...
 first, i don't see a need to carry a concealed gun traveling across states
 second, you have no option except to follow the rules unless you try to run for some government position
 third, the CCW permit clearly have the name of the state on them
 fourth, different state have different requirements for a CCW permit
 fifth, if this restriction between different states is not set up, there are too many loop holes people can find because each state have different governments and set up different laws
