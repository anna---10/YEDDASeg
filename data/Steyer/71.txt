TITLE: Are mermaids real

CATEGORY: Science

"I believe that most mermaids some are not majestic animals and would probably cause harm to people do to there past inter actions with people. "
 
 Once again, No evidence. The authorities agree that there's no evidence as well. [1]
 
 "There is a mermaid museum where they have fossilized mermaids "
 
 Where? Is there evidence that these fossils are real?
 
 "and there is a man who reported seeing a mermaid while in a submarine and he got it on video so if at one point in time they were real"
 
 Show me the video? Just because says it happened doesn't make it true.
 
 "not only reported sightings but there are also videos then they are real in my opinion. "
 
 Show me?
