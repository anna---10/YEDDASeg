TITLE: Should people have lovers?

CATEGORY: Society

I think that nowadays people have a lot of lovers and it does not matter while man or women cheating, but the important thing is unfair for people that they love and still have relationships, in fact some people think lovers can help to solve some problems in relationships or cheating secretly just sometimes it's not so big issue and they will not leave from theirs couple. I am arguing that people should not have lovers and they need to find really that kind of person who will be the last person ever to love to respect and appreciate relationships because Love it's important for making family and have baby or kids.
