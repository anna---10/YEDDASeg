TITLE: Should Minimum Wage Be Raised?

CATEGORY: Politics

Just to clarify my advocacy once more: I support raising the federal minimum wage requirement in the United States to $10.10/hr, as proposed by a petition of 600 economists -- including 7 Nobel Prize-winning ones. [1]
 
 My opponent's argument is plagiarized, from this source ( http://www.newsmax.com... ). Put your own effort into debates, or lose. It's that simple.
 
 In any case, Con's arguments are nonsensical anyway.
 
 One, Con concedes that the Supreme Court agrees with the minimum wage's constitutionality. We presume something is constitutional unless proven otherwise. The role of the State is to maximize benefit to the citizens - it's that simple. Since a minimum wage hike does that, it should exist. There's no "uncertainty" as to whether it's constitutional. Also, this is an is/ought fallacy - what's already there in the constitution doesn't mean it should necessarily be upheld.
 
 Two, there's no way to prove consent necessarily took place. Employers have an incentive to cut costs, and that includes low wages. If everyone pays low wages, there's no question of consent, because there's no choice in the first place - all business would pay low wages without a minimum wage. There are fifteen million workers who earn less than $10/hr in America, according to the Economic Policy Institute. [2] They're exploited that way, and if there's a monopoly (e.g. Walmart, which pays workers $9/hr) or if all businesses pay low wages to workers, then there's no consent involved. There's no way to prove consent, because these "contracts" are driven by necessity.
 
 Three, the notion that it would cause the loss of so many jobs is wrong. A review of the literature on the subject by economist John Schmitt found that a minimum wage hike would have no discernible effect on employment whatsoever. [3] Minimum wage jobs exist in industries which are non-exportable, so there's no other way to get cheap labor, and corporations rely on labor. It's simple logic: industries need a certain amount of labor, and that's the only amount they're going to hire. I don't deny that a minimum wage hike to something like $15/hr would cause some unemployment, because at that point workers would be efficient enough to allow for less labor, but at anything less that $13/hr, there's not going to be a significant effect - most research agrees. Economist Michael Reich explains, "[D]ata shows that an increase up to $13 an hour has no measurable effect on employment." [4] Card and Krueger found that, in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, there were no negative employment effects whatsoever due to their respective minimum wages. [5] So Con's claim here is nonsensical too.
 
 Con talks about the EITC, but fails to prove that an EITC would be effective at reducing poverty. A mandatory minimum wage is more effective than the EITC, because it has a bunch of unique benefits that I will go into soon. An EITC sucks up government spending, which means there's no way by which to cut the corporate tax rate (which is an unnecessary burden on employers and merely creates an incentive to fire more employees) and focus the government spending on more important things that need to be achieved. Poverty can be alleviated by a minimum wage without necessitating for more tax revenue being required, and the minimum wage provides certain unique benefits (e.g. increased consumption and greater productivity) that an EITC fails to provide.
 
 Meanwhile, there are good reasons to raise the minimum wage. I provided an overview of those reasons, and Con doesn't address any of the arguments made. I hope to expand on some of them now.
 
 First, employers have an incentive to keep wages low, and so they'll keep wages low. Hard-working people won't be able to earn a living from all the hard work they do. The Congressional Budget Office reports that raising the minimum wage to $10.10 would lift 900,000 people from poverty. [6] A more liberal estimate, by Arindrajit Dube, found that an increase to $10.10 (about 39% increase) would immediately lift 4.6 million people from poverty, and, over time, would lift 6.8 million people. [7] This many people being lifted from poverty far outweighs any negative impact from a minimum wage hike. Lifting people from poverty is inherently good. These people can't meet their basic interests - while we live in the lap of luxury, some people don't get a plate of food every day. 17 million children in the United States live in food insecure households. [8] Duncan Walker of BBC News quotes one such child as saying, "Sometimes we don't have cereal and we have milk. Sometimes when there's a cooking show on I get a little more hungry - I want to vanish into the screen and start eating the food." [8] Living in poverty isn't easy. While some go and eat at expensive restaurants, others tear at the sight of such food when they know they can never afford it. That's enough reason to hike the minimum wage.
 
 Second, reducing poverty like that means the government has to spend significantly less on welfare programs, social security, earned income tax credit, etc. 73% of American welfare expenditure is because of insufficient wages. [9] That's 73/100 x $454 billion = $331 billion, and nearly that much will be saved because of the amount of people that will be lifted out of poverty. That also opens the United States to reduce corporate tax rates, which would boost employment and further increase wages, creating an endless cycle of advancing human welfare.
 
 Third, a minimum wage hike would boost consumption and increase productivity, thus boosting the economy. That's because people love spending newly-earned money -- they have an urge to spend. Basic behavioral psychology suggests as much. And behavioral economists agree too. That means, the less poor people become, the more they consume products. [10] The more consumption, the supply-side is boosted as well, which results in -- overall -- economic growth. A $1.75 hike in the minimum wage would increase consumption by $48 billion annually. [10] We're talking about a $2.85 hike, so the effects are nearly $100 billion more made by businesses annually. Furthermore, most research agrees that a minimum wage hike would boost productivity. [11] [12] That could mean growth in excess of $200 billion. [11]
 
 Businesses could gain up to $300 billion annually, millions of workers could be lifted up from poverty, there's no harm from a minimum wage hike, EITC expansion alone would suck up too much government revenue which is better-invested elsewhere, and welfare costs are reduced significantly, allowing for greater improvement in human welfare. For all those reasons, vote Pro.
