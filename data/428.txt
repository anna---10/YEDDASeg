 Circumference of a circle is currently defined as 2πr, whereas area of a circle is defined as πr�. Similarities of these formulas easily result in transposition of the numeral 2, providing vastly different, and potentially dangerous, results. The use of a separate symbol for circumference reduces the possible incidence of errors.
