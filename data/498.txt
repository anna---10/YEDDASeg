TITLE: terror against freedom

CATEGORY: Science

My opponent says Islam is terrorism which is not. Islam is a religion that has 1.6 billion people. I must ask are all those peoples including mothers,fathers,sons,daughters,and family are considered terrorist for simply following the religion.
 
 On terrorism there has been over 150 thousand terrorist attacks since 1970.Lets say that all of those attacks were committed by people of Islam. Those terrorist represent most likely 0.00009% of people that follows Islam.You have a better chance getting struck by lightning in your lifetime then experiencing a Muslim committing a terrorist acts in your life.
 
 You are labeling Muslims as terrorist that apply terrorism but actually 5/12 (42%)Nobel peace prize holders are Muslims.That is very important that shows Muslims belief made more people become Nobel peace prize holders.
 
 These are why Islam is not a terrorism.
