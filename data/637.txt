TITLE: Britian is a christian culture

CATEGORY: Politics

I will argue that Britain is a Christian country. Firstly church has always had an intertwining link with state in Britain ever since the edict of Milan. Britain was largely dominated by Christianity 100's of years before the angles and Saxons had arrived and invaded before there was an England. Church attendance figures in the 60's were at 50-60 % I will admit that is a 10% decline from ww1 however it was pretty consistent and far from insignificant, those who called themselves Christian was around 85 % called themselves Christian. This 30 year sharp decline is the most insignificant dot on the sheer length and influence Christianity has had in British culture and society. In fact we have had drops of this magnitude before right before the Christian reformation in the late 1700's Wilberforce etc. church attendance was 30% which had been declining ever since the English protestant revolution. The fact is just because a significant decline within 20 years occurs it does not mean we should rip and tear up the fundamental foundations of British society and culture.
