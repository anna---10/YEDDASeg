TITLE: You cant be Racist Towards White People

CATEGORY: Society

It seems you have forefited ?
 
 Also blacks are only a third of police brutality victims while commiting 40% of violent assaults. This in no way entails racism, it entails justice.
 
 White people do not have structural power over blacks, some of the wealthiest men in america are black (Dr,Dre worth 500 million dollars etc) You cannot blame your lack of ambition and intuition in an entire race. Some people get luvky in life, some people are unlucky and others work their asses off and get rich, some work their asses off and manage to lift themselves even the slightest out of poverty. I have bothing to argue against since you forfited so im stuck with what to say
