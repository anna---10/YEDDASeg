TITLE: the democratic party

CATEGORY: Politics

sorry for that sketchy ending on my last argument-you know, all the "http 500" stuff.
 
 perhaps the most obvious flaw to republicans is that they don't want the government to control stuff. you know what that's called?
 ANARCHY!!!
 he's been asking me to provide sources all this debate, so here's the google definition of anarchy.
 
 a state of disorder due to absence or nonrecognition of authority.
 
 Sounds pretty much like the whole "kill the government" thing.
 
 it's also hypocritical, because since republicans are a dominant force in politics, they must therefore be involved with the government. politicians are government, man. democrats accept that and know it. Saying that republicans aren't part of the government is like saying that donald trump isn't the spawn of satan. both are untrue.
 
 You'll note that old password usually goes with over two thousand words on his arguments, just to impress voters, but in that last argument, he only went with about 500 by my estimate, so he's obviously just adding a bunch of filler to impress you guys.
 
 Vote for me, but I know you won't, because you're mostly republicans.
