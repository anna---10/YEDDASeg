TITLE: Should abortion be abolished or not?

CATEGORY: Society

Ok, then if you say about consequences of unsafe sex it means that you agree with protected sex. However, do not you think that it is also about killing unborn child? So, if it comes to religion then it means that unsafe sex also has to be banned. Moreover, I would like to add that 14% of 14-year-old girls become pregnant before they turn 20 annually. We cannot be totally sure that it could not happen to someone close to us. There is a question : Should the penalty for lack of knowledge or even for a moment's carelessness be enforced pregnancy and child rearing? Or you think that they have to make dangerous illegal abortion? Also if it comes to teenage abortion then how do you think will it be beneficial for them, for society, country and relatives to birth this child even when they have not got diploma and life experience? How they will bring up their children even if they are children by themselves yet? Also to conclude I would like to add that abortion should not be illegal, because it is, first of all, about liberty to choose they are ready or not to give a life to a child. Moreover, we should not press a teenager to live in a life of joblessness, hopelessness, and dependency.
