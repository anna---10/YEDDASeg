TITLE: Abortion is killing

CATEGORY: Politics

The unprofessional abortion can be considered feticide, and can be up to 20 years in prison. A professional abortion by a doctor is safe, clean. And to be considered abortion has to meet several requirements before being allowed to abort. You can't abort a 30 week baby? At least I don't think so.
