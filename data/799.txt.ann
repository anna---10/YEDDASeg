TITLE: Would the Gulf States Work More Efficiently as a Separate Nation

CATEGORY: Politics

<<<outside of argumentation>>>
With recent developments, such as the oil spill, it's a wonder there hasn't been one word about the gulf states(Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and Florida) from succeeding from the U.S.. Texas even has the legal right to do so. It's obvious that the rest of the nation has anything but completely forgotten the spill. It was not even mentioned in President Obama's State of the Union. It is clearly evident that the oil is not gone. When you make something smaller and disperse it over a larger area it does not go away. Hence the term "dispersant". The oil is now at a molecular level working it's way up the food chain and most locals have stopped eating fish caught in our area. Meanwhile the process of snatching a claim from BPs iron clasp has made it impossible for many people to get a fraction of what they are owed. To top it off the U.S. government decided to hand it's air tanker contracts to a company well known for fraud instead of sending it to the hard working and honest Northrop-Grumman facilities in Alabama, a state which most northerners few as primitive and mostly agricultural. Alabama in fact has well balanced agricultural and industrial settings. Don't get me started on how idiotic Obama's response was either. Instead of consulting any of the gulf states he decided to put a huge halt on off shore drilling which is a major workforce for the coast.

The United States may have finally gotten to big and divided to function as a whole.

Why should the gulf be able to act only slowly through it's senators which are generally looked down upon by other states. Southern states are viewed much the same way many Americans view Islam. The public singles out the extremes and broadcasts them all over the world. We are much more intelligent than the rednecks you see on TV and the sleazy slow talking politicians that couldn't succeed as lawyers or in Bentley's case doctors. The latter is mainly due to the fact that the intellectuals in southern states know the prejudice faced by politicians from our state and as such stay well away from the title governor and senator
