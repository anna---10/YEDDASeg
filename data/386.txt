TITLE: Romney's Work at Bain Capital Helped Companies

CATEGORY: Politics

I thank my opponent for such an interesting, apropos, and enlightening debate.  I have learned much from the well researched citations in support of the pro argument.
 
 The burden that pro took on was simple: companies were better with/after Bain Capitol than they were before[1].  For this reason it is not necessary to connect any dots, it is not necessary to analyze all the steps taken and supply evidence that Bain was directly responsible for the decisions.  If a company did better with/after Bain than before, Bain got the credit for the net good that had transpired.  If a company was worse off, Bain must take the responsibility.
 
 Certainly my opponent can not expect Bain to be able to take all the reward of success without taking the blame failures.  It is a poor leader that reaps the profits of his squad but makes them bear the burden for their failures.  Bain does this in the financial world already, but that was not the groundrules for the debate.
 
 Simply put: were companies better off after Bain than before?  Not always.  Often enough to show a pattern the company was made so vulnerable that it filed for bankruptcy.  Many survived, indeed thrived.  Not all.  To those that went under it had a devestating effect on the workers and community, and these things must also be considered as part of the whole.
 
 Does the good that Bain Capitol accomplished outweigh the negative effect they had on companies that did not survive?  It depends on what is valued.  Bain gambled with companies, and never lost.  That is because when the dice came up bad, it was the company and the workforce who paid the price.
 
 Again, I thank my opponent and look forward to hearing his other arguments in the future.
