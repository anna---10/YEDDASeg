TITLE: Is Nazi ideology still valid today?

CATEGORY: Politics

I see many members on this site declare themselves members of the US Nazi party, (Oxymoron), with emphasis on the "moron". I am a Christian, have lived in Germany, speak German and have an intricate knowledge/university degree re: the history of the NSDAP/Hitler. I will crush through my intellect any "pro" Nazis that choose to meet their "Stalingrad".
