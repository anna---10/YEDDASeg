TITLE: Is America the greatest country in the world?

CATEGORY: Politics

P1: You say," US does not lead in all those categories, it is still ahead of all the other countries when the averages of all the rankings of all the countries in all the categories are compared". US does not lead in many categories as I said except three which irrelevant to the strength, power, and greatness of a country. And to add to the "average" comment, if you do the math right if you are far behind 8 categories and only ahead in 3 irrelevant categories you are still not on top.
 P2: We don't welcome the greatest amount of immigrants, its actually Canada.  http://www.huffingtonpost.com... 
 
 This proves that America is not the greatest country in the world.
