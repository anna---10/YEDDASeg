TITLE: IVF Debate

CATEGORY: Science

The decision to undergo IVF treatment is completely up the the couple/person. It's exactly like everything else in life, those with more money have more opportunities. The risks and chances of a successful outcome are completely explained to the parents, so their choice to agree on the procedure is with them having full knowledge of it. Some people believe that the chance of having a child of their own is worth the money.
 
 During IVF, the embryos are examined using genetic screenings. These screenings only add to the benefits of IVF. As explained in an article by Leslie A. Pray, Ph.D., the technology can be used to look at the embryos before they are placed in the mother's womb. Having the knowledge of the genes of each embryo, specific ones can be selected and used a to reduce the risk of genetic diseases to pass on to the child and the child's offspring. These opportunities to increase the health of offspring are available and should be taken advantage of.
