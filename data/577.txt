TITLE: Was the anti-LGBT bill in North Carolina just?

CATEGORY: Politics

Moral Framework
 
 Before we can rule whether or not a law is just, we must first identify what institutes an unjust law. An unjust law is called so if it meets the criterion of being harmful to human good, or conflicts with natural law. [1] ( precise description of how nature behaves under specific circumstances). An example would be the permittance of theft, or the enforcement of abortions in China. With human reason, we can determine whether or not a law is contradictory with nature. Naturalism theorizes that if a law is not morally permissible, then it is not a law. [2]
 
 "Consequently, since law is chiefly ordained to the common good, any other precept in regard to some individual work must be devoid of the nature of law, save in so far as it regards the common good." - St. Thomas Aquinas
 
 House Bill Two
 
 House bill two was passed approximately on March 23, 2016. This bill states that the biological sex (The physical condition of being male or female, which is stated on a birth certificate) of an individual must adhere to the sex on a facility"s bathroom door sign. [3] This is not mandatory, it is at the full discretion of the facility"s owner. [3] We live in an free market, this will be an advertising chip for certain businesses. The bill is not a prejudicial treatment or ostracization of a group, it"s merely enforcement of what should already be implied. Identity is irrelevant and entirely subjective, if law were to conform to it, what would prevent a burly man from entering the women"s room? Who are we to deny him? Remember, we are not in an argument for the end of urinary segregation.
 
 House Bill Two Is Just
 
 The chief disagreement is if the bill is fair, with the paradigm of a law being either just or unjust, we can easily decide that it is in fact, the former. The law isn"t harmful to human good, if anything, it prevents certain circumstances from transpiring under someone"s illusionment of self-identity. The law is also not in conflict with natural law, and I challenge you to prove otherwise. There is an obvious reason that women bathrooms tend to never contain urinals, they weren"t designed for men.
