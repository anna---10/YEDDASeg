TITLE: Airline flights should be taxed much higher than they already are

CATEGORY: Economics

Thank-you.
 
 My first point is that air travel is a major contributor towards global warming and climate change. The emmission contains extremely harmful gases which damage our ozone layer. (3)As much as we can turn off our lights when we leave the room, or always recycle our cans, it is basically all cancelled out by air travel. This article shows some major reasons why we need to help slow down global warming and the effects it is having on our environment. (1) This article shows that, among other things, global warming and climate change is also responsible for a huge amount of species becoming extinct (2) Air travel massively contributes towards climate change, therefore also contributing towards the extinction of species and the destruction of our environment. Should the human race really put the ecological balance of the earth on the brink, just so we can have some quick travel?
 
 My second point, is that having a higher tax on air line tickets will make people stop and think whether they really want to fly. As they becoming increasingly cheap, people buy them usually without weighing out other options such as taking the train. Taxing them higher will encourage people to look at other options which have a lower tax on our environment (no pun intended).
 
 I look forward to your arguments.
