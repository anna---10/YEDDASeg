TITLE: There Should be a Limit of One Black Family per Neighborhood

CATEGORY: Society

I believe that there should certainly be a strict limit of one black/African family per neighborhood, due to their high crime rates and violence. You see, while it is racist to entirely segregate society by race, we must do what we can do at the moment to reduce/minimize violence caused by blacks.
 
 Thus, there should be a limit of one black family per neighborhood in every country, including African countries.
