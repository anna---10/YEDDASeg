TITLE: DNA is a code and therefore requires an intelligence to create it

CATEGORY: Science

I say language transfers information to an intelligence and you say it communicates. These mean the same thing. Communication implies knowledge, which in turn implies intelligence " at BOTH ends of the communication. When a DNA molecule undergoes a chemical reaction, it is not communicating anything to anyone.
 
 Human minds storing an MLK speech on DNA is no different than storing it on colored rocks. Both cases involve storing symbols and then symbol reading by humans, not a direct chemical reaction.
 
 DNA does not "convey info on instructions to build proteins". It directly causes the proteins to form as a result of the chemical reactions that it undergoes. Chemicals don't communicate. They interact physically.
