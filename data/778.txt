TITLE: Women should be treated with the respect men get.

CATEGORY: Society

In your analogy where you replaced giving control to women with the color red, implies that giving control to women is a fundamental piece of being a man. THAT makes no sense. My statement does.
 
 The Holy Bible is the most sexist document I have ever read and it is what I shape my life around, I could not truly be Christian without being sexist. My father was a great man but he was far to submissive to that ***** he called a wife. She was always trying to take control even though my father was obviously the more dominant, intelligent and deserving person. One day he conjured the guts to realize what was happening and he put her in her place. But that wretched, lonesome species of his wife reacted like an animal and shot him, she was taken to jail, leaving me all alone, that is what feminism causes.
