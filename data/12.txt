TITLE: Should buffer zones for pro-life protesters exist around abortion clinics?

CATEGORY: Society

The main argument against the existence of buffer zones is that they violate rights to freedom of speech and assembly for pro-life protesters, however, free speech and assembly rights do not extend to harassment. By being able to go directly up to a woman going to the clinic to argue with her and try to stop her violates her legal right to go to the clinic.
 One of the reasons that pro-life use in their argument is that the suicide rate for women after they have had abortions is extremely high. While this is true, the stigma, harassment and shaming they receive from the community contributes to this, and being yelled at from only a couple feet away that you are a murderer and going to Hell on one of the most difficult days of their lives is not healthy for one's mental state. For the protection of the rights of women going to these clinics as well as their physical and mental safety, buffer zones should exist to allow protesters to assemble, but not to be right next to the clinic so that women can exercise their rights in peace.
