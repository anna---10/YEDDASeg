TITLE: With tensions between the Flemish and Walloons, is it possible that Belgium will split up?

CATEGORY: Politics

In order to clear things up, I am speaking about the social and political division of Belgium. The Dutch speaking Flemish wants more independence, while the French Speaking Walloons wants the nation to be united. This feud is mainly economic, for the Flemish wants economic autonomy, while the Walloons argue that they won't benefit from the economic gains coming from the wealthier Flemish regions. Now this feud has reached politics, as linguistic divisions as well as economic debates threatens the very existence of the Belgian government. As far as socially, many Belgians (both Walloons and Flemish), are calling for a new government, in which both ethnic groups can benefit. Now with the new Interim government installed, representatives have stated that this form of government is temporary, that it will only be in existence for three months. Personally speaking, I believe that this situation will be resolved with out the political and social splitting of the government, and the people.
