TITLE: Abortion

CATEGORY: Politics

Aborting a child for the convenience of the mother's life style is murder and a lazy excuse for being responsible. A mother's love should be without restrictions. If she can not take care of a child, it should be put up for adoption. According to the National Council for Adoption, "Babies, regardless of medical problems, who are "free for adoption,"generally do not wait long for families. There are waiting lists of couples who would like to adopt infants with Down Syndrome or Spina Bifida. There are also a large number of couples who would like to adopt terminally ill babies, including babies with AIDS. There are between one and two million infertile and fertile couples and individuals who would like to adopt children."  http://www.abortionno.org... 
 By stopping abortions, there will be more children available to adopt by families wanting to provide those unwanted children a forever home.
