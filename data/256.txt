TITLE: Being on social networking sites, a curse for teenagers?

CATEGORY: Society

Today I would like to debate on a topic, which is a major issue of concern amongst most of the parents and teenagers as well. R the growng social networkng sites,and spurtring interest of childrens (specialy teenages) in them a curse or a blessing for them?
 According to me, the social networkng sites are continuously tryng to vilify the mindset of new generation. They are givng precedence to these sites over all other things. Anyone who feels the opposite is coordiately invited to mention there respective views on the topic.
