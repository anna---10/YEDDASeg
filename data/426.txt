TITLE: Alien life

CATEGORY: Science

Ok but the definition of life is always changing. i agree that it would take primitive non human life to get to where we are. also when i say life, i just don't talk about intelligible life. im also talking about germs, viruses, fish, or even quadrupeds. don't get me wrong i believe in god too.to me evolution is a more descriptive version of creationism. one of the conditions of life is water, where there is water there s some kind of life. like on icy moons. scientist have even found that molecular life can exist even on comets. from fossils from comets. Also you don't have to agree with evolution but the evidence for it found every day. i also agree that god created the earth and the universe. it just took a lot longer than the two or three thousand years the bible said it took him. evolution is part of god just like we are apart of him.
