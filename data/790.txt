TITLE: Resolved: The United States should encourage the implementation of a soft partition in Iraq.

CATEGORY: Politics

the surge is just about over, troop levels will begin to fall in july. after that then what? we will no longer be able to secure the country, violence will rise and the progress we made will erode. we have to think about what will happen with less troops in Iraq, and eventually none at all. soft partitioning the country will not only help to pacify Iraq, it will also help the Iraqis take the rains for their own protection.
 
 "stick with what works"
 as I've said, the surge is practically over, staying the course will result in even more violence and bloodshed after troop levels fall. we cannot be afraid to try a new strategy in Iraq. we have to have the courage to do what is best for Iraq in the long term, we have to encourage the soft partition of Iraq.
 
 i urge you to vote Aff.
