TITLE: Guns

CATEGORY: Politics

Some topics need deep thought, this is not one of those. My point is simple, there is no reason one needs to own a gun. There are numerous reasons that one might "want" to own a gun. Hunting? This is the 21st century, does anyone outside of Alaska still need to hunt to feed their family? No. Would anyone need a gun for self defense, if no guns are possessed by the public? No. There's no threat to Americans way of life whatsoever. So therefore, no guns needed.
