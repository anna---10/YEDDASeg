TITLE: Intellectual property impedes societal progress!

CATEGORY: Society

Nobody can truly own an idea. It is a made up standard which can't be enforced if nobody adheres to this silly doctrine. What if there was a patent on the wheel, or fire making or agricultural? I encourage everyone to ignore pattents, and I especially encourage college students to secretly record their professors lectures and post them on youtube at the end of the semester!!!!
