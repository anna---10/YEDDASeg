TITLE: A $15 minimum wage would destroy America's economy forever.

CATEGORY: Politics

Thanks for accepting!
 
 Here are a few key points I will be putting out:
 
 Mexico is already killing us when it comes to economy lately, due to labor cost.
 Norway, Sweden and Denmark, who consistently top the lists of happiest places to live, don"t have a standard minimum.
 When you raise the cost of something, you get less of it
 Job level will get crushed and machines will take over
 Small businesses can't handle it.
 
 To the ear, it sounds perfect. Everyone gets more money, and therefore poverty is gone! Everyone is happy! But it only takes a little bit of thinking to notice that somebody has to pay off these raised salaries, and if they can't do such a dramatic increase, the employers will be forced to fire people, and replace them. These people will therefore become jobless, which impacts our economy and the lives of the people.
 
 An even worse scenario would be if the company decides to move all jobs located in America to a place where they can actually afford to employ people to do work. America will crash, and not be able to ever return from such a big blow to the American labor force.
 
 The United States have lost five million manufacturing jobs since 2000 (Money.CNN.com) Mexico is one of the key components of this job takeaway, as the cost of labor in the US is constantly rising, the cost for labor in Mexico is quickly dropping, so many American CEO's have decided to leave the Americans unemployed and hiring Mexicans for less money, which generates more profit.
 
 Also, small businesses won't even be able to relocate or make machines, they will just quickly crash and "bern". Small businesses throughout the nation, hardworking people, will be force to forget their dreams and close their doors.
