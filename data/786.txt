TITLE: Adults applying for welfare assistance should undergo drug screening

CATEGORY: Politics

drug screenings usually cost more than the savings they allow for.

 it's not worth spending more money merely as a matter of principle just to keep them off the welfare rolls.
 
 plus as a practical matter. most welfare receipients don't get that much welfare. welfare here is being defined in the narrow sense as cash assistence. often it's only three years tops. and only if they have young children. if they want to spend a little on drugs, maybe they shouldnt, but it's de minimis what is being wasted, and in some sense more power to them to blow smalls change on whatever floats their boat. so they didnt buy household goods but chose to suffer some for drugs, give them a little liberty. at elast when teh savings are not there to do teh tests. even if you defined welfare more broadly, at least federally, only ten percent of money is spent on the poor. stop quibbling over small fries, especially when quibbling costs more than not in the first place.
