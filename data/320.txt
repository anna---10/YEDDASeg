TITLE: Slumdog Millionaire Portrays Poverty and Affluence Well

CATEGORY: Society

Surprisingly, poverty and its reality does not - as many assume - wipe all fantasy, hope, and spirit from a person. Jamal Malik's life is proof of that. It is the quintessential fantasy of a rags-to-riches story that rings close to home for many who wish to live a life with less difficulties even if only financially. Its predictability enables it to be a sweet film that speaks on subjects that the Western world are not used to. Jamal's story has an unbelievability ultimately due to the fact that it was never meant to be written as an expose of slumdogs, but a modern love story. So deeply entrenched in the story line is the fact that life "is written" and so, it shall be. Truthfully, Slumdog Millionaire is popular because the cinematic world was ready for a fairy tale. This films will have theatre-goers leaving with a lifted spirit and that inspirational feeling that changes one's outlook on global issues and one's life.
 
 As much as it seems like common sense to realize that India is not one big slum, there are many who do not realize that ask if there are computers and cars there. Whenever India is portrayed negatively in the media, it is hard to think fantastic. It is understandable that people become offended that slums are shown in such an extreme, however, the film clearly shows that those living in the slums are not entirely destitute and depressing. People had lives and were happy.
 
 Indian poverty is a subject�already addressed. Slumdog Millionaire�is not the first movie about a�child growing up in the slums of Bombay. There was one ten years ago called Salaam Bombay, it was also nominated for an Oscar and was made by an Indian director. This also is not the first movie to feature religious riots, the Indian mafia, or child prostitution. Good filmmaking is a matter of combining the right elements in the right ways such that the combination is above and beyond what has been done before. In the storytelling, the movie excels. Boyle treats poverty and those who live in it as individuals with their own, unique stories quite like us, not faceless objects to be pitied.
 with where they were. Although, in general, conditions can be improved.
 
 Approximately 13.5 percent Canadian adults are likely to experience depression at some point during their lifetime because they are overwhelmed by the events in their daily lives. All the countless issues we complain about are relatively insignificant compared to what people in poverty in countries like India experience. We have been accustomed to a very materialistic life where our low income cut-off line is approximately $22 000. What we think is a basic need seems to be a luxury in these slums. One comes to realize that there was something more that Jamal's story can teach. We should not forget that love, friendship, freedom, and family is of so much value. But anyone from the slums are already aware of the ingenuity, entrepreneurial skills and family bonds that they each rely on to thrive under conditions that would break most of us. It reassured me that it is truly worth the fight to make sure we never forget to live our lives the way we are intended to. That we need to believe in the ethics of humanity, show responsibility towards nature and life around us, treasuring the little things and moments that life has to entail, have hope, and the willingness to sacrifice.
 
 Not to give away the plot of the movie for those who have yet to watch it, Jamal's story will take you on a journey where you could not help, but wonder how fortunate most North Americans are in our lives, yet we fail to appreciate all the niceties that life has to offer.
