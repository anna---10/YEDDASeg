TITLE: Resolved: That the United States should intervene in another nation's struggle for democracy.

CATEGORY: Politics

Crossfire:
 
 1. Germany was certainly NOT a word power before WWII. Germany was coming out of a terrible economic depression, Japan was also just becoming economically stable by expanding its territories. After such a vehement leader as Hitler, and the demi-god emperor Tojo, it is almost suprising that democracy ever developed in these countries. In addition, the resolution does not limit this debate to modern conflicts.
 
 2. Sorry here are my sources.ï¿½ http://www.ncjrs.gov... ;(Yes West Berlin starved until the soviets lessened the blockade.)
 
 3. Exactly. Many poor countries were colonized in the past and forced to slave or near-slave labor. Modern day imperialism is a direct result of economic spheres of influence. These influences are a direct result of corrupt leaders/ corporations. In a democratic society corrupt leaders are voted out and corporations have limited power, thereafter limiting foreign influence in the country.
 
 4. Can you expand on that point and relate it to the argument?
 
 5. Sometimes setting up a democracy involves military intervention, the case in Iraq and Afghanistan. But sometimes not, Germany, Japan.
 
 6. Wars that would be started by non-democratic, hostile countries.
 
 As a side note I would like to point out that my opponents sources are neither relevant OR cited in his argument. A bit odd coming from someone who demands sources :P
