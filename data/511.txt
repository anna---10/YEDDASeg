TITLE: LGBTQA Rights

CATEGORY: Politics

Thank you for promptly responding.
 
 I am in agreement with the concept that the LGBTQA community should not be denied any services, because that is a clear attack on their human rights. However, the lifestyle that the LGBTQA community chooses to persue is blatantly sinful, and wrong in the eyes of God. It is stated clearly in the Bible that homosexuality, and other deviations of sexuality, are sinful (Leviticus 18:22). The Bible is also very clear that no homosexual will enter into the kingdom of God (1 Corinthians 6:9-11). I believe beyond a shadow of a doubt that the Bible is God's holy and perfect word, and that everything in the Bible is undoubtedly TRUE. God never intended for a man to lie with a man, or a woman with a woman; this behavior is detestable.
 The LGBTQA community exhibits behavior that has changed the way God intended this world to function.
 
 As I have expressed my personal views on this subject , I am extremely interested in knowing your personal views on the matter. What are your religious views on God, the Bible, and homosexuality?
