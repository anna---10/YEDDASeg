TITLE: Agender is an acceptable identification

CATEGORY: Society

Agender: The state of having no gender. People say this is just as acceptable as having a gender, whether it be male, female, or trans. I say no. It's impossible not to have a gender of any sort! Whether you identify as something or not doesn't mean you really are that thing. If I identify as a table, does that make me a table? Same goes for this.
