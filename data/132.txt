TITLE: The words racist and racism are used too loosely in society

CATEGORY: Politics

In today's society and culture the accusation that something is racist or some is a racist is used too often. What is racism? It is the belief that a group of people divided by race are INFERIOR genetically. Now research shows that races do have differences beyond skin color and these differences are not something that is positive from person to person. For example some are taller, longer life expectancy, and are more likely to have certain diseases later in life. People of race can fall into certain categories in society no matter the country. For example the Germans always have been lead piano makers no matter the country as studies have shown. But these differences do not in any sense qualify someone as inferior or superior. Now, a politician brought up that more hurricanes are named after whites than blacks and this is racist. Such is one of the many bad ways of using the world. Does she really believe that the people who name the hurricanes believe the whites are genetically superior than blacks. No, I believe she wants blacks to be more represented which is understandable, people take pride of who they are and what they are. In conclusion, racism is an evil that exists in this world and is morally wrong, but it is not as common as some people would like to think.
