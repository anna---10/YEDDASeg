TITLE: has democracy become a form of government in which you choose your own dictator?

CATEGORY: Politics

First of all I would like to apologise for my mistake, by congress I meant different leaders of the party. Each leader of the party failed to live up to the expectation of the general public like their handling of the Union budget 2013 proving again that once elected candidates start dictatorial rule and forget expectation of people.

 "Actually, as an American citizen, I can tell you that the majority of the public either agreed with or were indifferent to the invasion of Iraq. A poll by Gallup in May of 2003 showed that 79% of American citizens thought the invasion of Iraq was justified [1]."
 
 From June 2005- December 2008 there were many more polls conducted like the one in September of 2007 by ipsos public affairs which clearly shows that 33%people agreed with Bush while 65% people in the U.S. were not happy with the decision made by Bush regarding the "situation in Iraq". Hurricane Katrina was handled poorly and Bush had also refrained from having the federal government immediately take over the relief efforts and in a time of such jeopardy he was praising the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency proving once again that in a democracy all the general public can do is choose its own dictator because after acquiring the position the wishes of the general public are not considered by the chosen candidate.

 Yes there are very few democracies left but there really is no point of having them if its essence is not maintained. Who wants democracy to become a temporary dictatorship of the person who wins the support of the people and then forgets their wishes?
