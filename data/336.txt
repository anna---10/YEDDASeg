TITLE: Workplace internet restrictions

CATEGORY: Society

"the Internet is a great source of information. This Information could be put to good use in the workplace." 
 
 The internet gives good information for your work yes, but youre not going to find that information on sites like facbook, twitter, or pornhub..... 
 
  "When a company is not able to encourage the employees to focus on their tasks, wants to force them by forbidding other things that might be distracting! While, the lack of strong management, staffing, planning and a system which employees are requested to accomplish their duties; is leading to create difficulties." 
 
 I dont even know what youre argument is here because of how bad the grammar is....
 
  "Employees falling to procrastination during work is usually a sign of bad management, rather than a bad employee." 
 
 That is bull crap and everyone knows it. Have you ever had your mind wander while in class when the teacher was teaching math? We've all done that at one point, and its not the teachers fault either. If you cant focus on the task youre working on because you distract yourself, thats your own fault not anyone elses. 
 
  "And censorship is not really a true solution to the problem." 
 
 Its not a true solution but is sure helps the problem of employees not being able to focus on their work due to them screwing around on the internet all the time........
 
  "Censorship is not the solution." 
 
 We're not talking about internet censorship here we're talking about internet restrictions.... Theres a massive difference between the two.
