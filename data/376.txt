TITLE: Full 50-State Green Retrofit Initiative

CATEGORY: Politics

Sorry, I have to make my conclusion a little short. We're moving out of my house today and I don't have very much time or internet capacity. 
 
  In Conclusion 
 
 - Green energy is risky.
 
 - My opponent argued for more debt and debt for people already in debt because he thinks it is a "small amount", debt is debt. No energy project with such small yields is worth the extra debt incurred especially in our financial situation.
 
 - Neither the banks nor the federal government are in a secure position to guarantee loans - they can't even pay off the debt/payments they currently have much less ad BILLIONS of dollars in additional risk and spending.
 
 - All of the effects my opponent listed are exaggerated or are presented without the negative consequences.
 
 - Green retrofitting is EXTREMELY expensive in a time when most banks and American families have unstable financial situations this is bad policy.
 
 - My opponent asks for HIGHER energy bills NOW to get EVENTUAL savings. This doesn't sound like a good deal to me nor does it sound good for a struggling government and economy.
 
 While this energy retrofitting idea may be viable in the FUTURE in today's world with today's markets and economy it simply is not. We cannot take on more debt, we cannot afford the large loans in question, we cannot support HIGHER energy costs in the near future. Job creation in this economy is a myth and claiming you'll creat "1 million" jobs is a false claim Democrats have been making since 2009 when no jobs have been created. Guaranteeing loans and jobs in the green energy market has failed miserably up until this point. There is risk involved here.
 
 We cannot make this work in today's world.
 
  The resolution is thereby negated.
