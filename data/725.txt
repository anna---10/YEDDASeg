TITLE: Soldiers get less recognition for dying for there country than celebrities that die due to drugs

CATEGORY: Politics

There are soldiers out there everyday putting there lives on the line to save our country and help the world. Every time one of them day they get a little mention on the news but into no great detail. However with Whitney Houston and Amy Winehouse when they recently died from drug abuse they were all over the news all over the world. This isnt fair as they are getting recognition for doing a wrong and illegal thing. Surely the soldiers should get much more attention????
