TITLE: Obama's presidency has been successful so far

CATEGORY: Politics

Barack Obama entered office with one of the worst crises in American history. He has helped get America get back on track, and while recovery has been slow, it has been steady and will continue to get better. His many accomplishments include killing Osama Bin Laden, who was America's biggest threat in many years, ending the war in Iraq, which was a very unnecessary war, repealing Don't Ask, Don't Tell allowing Gays in the military, and saving the banks AND the US auto industry. But his biggest accomplishment is definitely the Affordable Care Act, it will cover over 32 million uninsured Americans by 2014. The economy is slowly getting better, and while it's not where we all want it to be, unemployment has steadily decreased, the stock market has steadily increased to what are now record levels and businesses are continuing to grow.Obviously what you will bring up is debt. Obama inherited the worst economy since the Great Depression, had to pay for two wars he did not start, and had to put a lot of money saving the auto industry and the banks, and bear the cost of increased national security required to combat terrorism. This costs money but with interest rates at record low levels it was a good time to borrow to grow and the saved economy will allow us to reduce the debt over time.
