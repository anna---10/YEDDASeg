TITLE: The United States should maximize production in coal.

CATEGORY: Economics

Thank you for your interest in opposing my stand on this matter. I believe the united states should maximize its coal production, assuming massive growth in the economy to follow. Many coal miners have lost their jobs, plants and mines have shut down, and the United States has lost its independence in energy production.
