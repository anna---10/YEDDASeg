TITLE: humanity will exist as a predominant species in the next 501 years??

CATEGORY: Society

The Human race is flawed in many obvious ways.
 I will begin the argument with this approach
 
 -It seems to diminish logic and reason all too often for it's better.
 By doing this humans take in account only how their lives would be affected by such actions at the very moment of thought.
 Even though humans realize this as truth this is still practiced and is considered human nature.
 
 With that i will like to add in consideration the current state of humanity:
 We are governed in a way which is barbaric as ideology of any orthodox rule has been.
 Our Governments ( i am talking about every "seprate" government in our little blue earth)is run through the power of the all mighty dallor.
 There is no actual freedom of choice for the people of this world. There is only an allusion, this propaganda is run only by the rich of this world. The politicians the "peace keepers" have close to no say in all the major decisions that take part on our earth. Money can overpower anything in it's decision it effects everything from scientific exploration to construction of the order of thought and believes of our public.
 This in it's self is slavery and our masters are dictators without doubt.
 
 To observe how this effects our debate we will establish that for a society to
 succeed in scientific achievements and constructing a promising future it must have as many of its peoples with similar status and control of any situation as possible.
 But as a result of this method of rule, all power is given to but a chosen few. and better still these corporate minds run through a very similar order of thought. There objective is to achieve more power and to make sure YOU have less. Thus continuesly plunging humanity further from achieving harmony.
