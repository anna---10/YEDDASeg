TITLE: Is elective abortion child abuse?

CATEGORY: Politics

I'm sorry to say that you haven't presented evidence. There is only one argument in this topic, and that is that a fetus is not a child. An abortion is the removal/extermination of a fetus from the womb.
 
 I won't be going out of my way in this topic.
