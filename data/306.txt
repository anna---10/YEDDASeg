TITLE: Resolved: Illicit drugs should be decriminalized and regulated by the FDA

CATEGORY: Politics

First of all, I never said that the increased government expenditures due to drug regulation would mean there would not be profit, I just said that the profit would not be worth the lives of addicts. Hardcore drugs can not be taken in moderation like alcohol. One simply does not do crack socially as he might with drinking. My opponent presents an overly idealistic view of a perfectly functioning FDA, and drug dealers who will simply back down when their business is taken away. Regulating illicit drugs doesn't change the fact they are deadly, and legalization would without a doubt increase use. ( http://denver.cbslocal.com...  " In 2014, when retail marijuana businesses began operating, that in only a year:
 
 " Marijuana-related traffic deaths increased 32 percent
 " Almost 20 percent of all traffic deaths were marijuana related compared to only
 " 10 percent less than five years ago
 " Marijuana-related emergency department visits increased 29 percent
 " Marijuana-related hospitalizations increased 38 percent
 " Marijuana-related calls to the rocky mountain poison center increased 72 percent
 " Diversion of Colorado marijuana to other states increased 25 percent") In Colorado, the legalization of marijuana has had negative impacts, and marijuana is comparatively very mild to hardcore drugs like meth or heroin. I have shown that the vastly negative impact of legalizing illicit drugs far out ways the meager benefits of profit, and a very unrealistic FDA taking the place of a drug dealers selling what might actually (due to dilution) be a safer product, and that is why I have won this debate.
