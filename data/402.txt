TITLE: Death Penalty

CATEGORY: Society

I have no philosophical/theoretical/moral objection to the death penalty. I'm not familiar with Leal Garcia, but I'm happy to assume for the sake of this argument that he's a bad person, that we'd be better off with him dead.
 
 My objection to the death penalty is practical. I was a lawyer. I have seen much injustice in the courts. Routine injustice. Lying cops, lying prosecutors, lying judges. Ignorance of the law you wouldn't believe. I once had a judge reject a speedy trial argument on this ground: "We don't do Constitutional law in this court." I saw a county judge tell the state court of appeals that they didn't have jurisdiction over him. I saw a judge say that he has "general policy" of refusing to set bond. A friend saw a judge tell a defendant, "Now, don't you go crawling off to some higher court!"
 
 Ask any lawyer you know: he'll tell you that he knows judges who, for lack of sense or judicial attitude, should not be judges.
 
 Every trial is a coin flip. The only way I expect justice from the court system is on average. That is, a guilty person may be acquitted this time, but he'll probably be arrested again, and he may be convicted that time; an innocent person may be convicted this time, but, if he's really a law-abiding type, he may not ever get prosecuted again.
 
 The court system is so unreliable that it shouldn't have the big gun. One study used DNA evidence to test the guilt of executed people. In _most_ of the cases it tested, the executed person was innocent. Irretrievably dead, but innocent. That's our court system at work, when it has the death penalty.
 
 We don't need the death penalty for deterrence; life imprisonment probably works as well. We shouldn't use the death penalty.
