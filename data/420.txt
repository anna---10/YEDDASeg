TITLE: Equality vs. Freedom

CATEGORY: Economics

The point that supporters of personal freedom routinely miss is that when the tax laws governing an economy favor wealthy business owners then fewer consumers are able to afford the products they sell. However, if these same proprietors pay their employees a decent living wage and are taxed an equal percentage from their earnings as the middle and lower classes are required to do then consumerism rises, more products are sold and the rich become a LOT richer. Everyone benefits.
