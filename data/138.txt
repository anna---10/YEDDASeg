TITLE: The United Kingdom should keep it's monarchy.

CATEGORY: Politics

Lets-a-go.
 To start, I just want to say that I believe the idea of Monarchy is a imbecilic, futile and overrated. It is the epitome of inequality.
 The monarchy is the line of reign a group of royalty have. The monarchs have NO power in Britain. Yes, they do technically pass laws, but a law has NEVER been denied by a King or a Queen of this age! They are figureheads. And figureheads get worn and people eventually stop caring about them. What really counts is the body, or the parliament in this case (Go UKIP!).
 
 Monarchs are born into their reign. From birth, they are automatically rich and have the ability to purchase anything to their desire. As a teen Brit, I think that is downright outrageous! Why should someone born to a specific family get more advantages than working families like mine?
 
 See where I am going? How is the above any different to Sexism? Racism? All forms of inequality? You can not deny that the new Prince George has done NOTHING to earn his multimillion funds that he will undoubtedly claim in the future. This is why Britain should banish the Royalty; they serve our country no justice.
