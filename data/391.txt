TITLE: Should America continue to give aide to Africa?

CATEGORY: Politics

Am not saying for America to stop but I think that we should have an amount to give, because were in need of aide ourselves. If you can't restore your own country why try to fix another, than your going to go downhill completley. How are we so sure of what Africa does with it's money, we give the money to the government not the people, we tell them what we expect them to do with the money but how can we be 100% sure that, they are using it on the civilians? Tell me what you think?
