TITLE: Plea bargaining in American criminal courts fails to achieve justice.

CATEGORY: Politics

I disagree because I killed a man once and I was looking at life, but I got a plea bargain and only got 30 years and now I am out of prison because I broke out. Don't tell anyone though I am in hiding. So I will describe what I did first I killed the man then I ran away. Then I got caught and went to prison. The first thing I did when I got there was dropping the soap. This really sucked. Then I dug with my hands through the wall in my cell and escaped. Now I am talking to you. DO NOT TELL ANYONE THOUGH I DONT WANT TO GO BACK.
