TITLE: there is no such thing as hell

CATEGORY: Science


  i can at best believe in hell.. stories are not real, as i cant see, hear, touch the stories beyond the words being spoken or where ever you get the story from. belief is false, be lie, as i dont know is true, and i have no beliefs 
  i see that i dont see a dog in my room right now, and i am certain that i am not, but i can believe there is a dog in my room that i cant see
