TITLE: Should schools be allowed to take non-educational Trips?

CATEGORY: Society

No, what I was saying was that the government isn't SUBSTANTIALLY increasing school budgets, at least around where I live. And you don't know the way most students think.
 
 I don't care if your class read some paper about field trips, and that experiment is complete trash, Their basing a survey on ONE class? Seriously? Yeah, talk about mass demographics! One class of students to base a study and opinion on! Golly gee whillikers! Why is it less likely for student to not go to a museum? I like museums. I like zoo's. Observation of nature is a fancy of mine! Please stop making opinions for me, I did not want to go see the avengers when It came out. Big whoop, right?
 
 You're last statements convince me jack squat to the superiority of non-educational fields trips to that of any other curricular activity. I enjoy education field trips I go on, I went to a Ski mountain to study snow fall and mountain animals, and I went to the local aquarium, to study to animals. Not all educational field trips are boring, quite the opposite in fact.
