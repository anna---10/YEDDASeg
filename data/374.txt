TITLE: Marches are not effective in combatting governmental abuse of power

CATEGORY: Society

Well, perhaps the best way to determine whether this is an issue we could actually debate would be for you to identify some specific marches that you believe were not effective in combating governmental abuse of power. I can propose a few marches that did combat governmental abuse of power:
 
 1. The veteran's marches circa 1932.
 2. The Selma march on Montgomery.
 3. The March on Washington.
 4. Ghandi's march.
 5. Pride marches.
 
 Notably, it is of course the case that these marches had agendas and were part of overarching movements that also involved other actions. As a general rule, marches are parts of overarching movements that have agendas, so restricting debate to marches that lack normal characteristics is not a fair test of the resolution.
 
 If you could propose some examples of marches that you would like to consider, perhaps this could be debated. But if we're simply in agreement that only a march that is defined arbitrarily to support your resolution can support your resolution, I'll accept your concession. ;)
