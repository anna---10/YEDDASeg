TITLE: Legalization of All Drugs ...

CATEGORY: Politics

' Legalizing all of the drugs would cause a world panic' My opponent has given no reason what so ever why it would cause world panic . ' People would die,' Legalization of all drugs would lead to the bankruption of the black market , and the legal market would be regulated therefore drug use would be safer and the risk of overdose from drugs like heroin would go down dramatically , I just explained that Drug legalization would cause less people to die from drug use and less people would die because of drug related violance . ' , country's would go broke because of all the drugs being smuggled into the country's. ' Why would drugs be smuggled if there wes a legal drug market in the country already?  and how does this relate to countries going broke? '  This would we almost as bad as the holocaust.'  That's one of the most irrational arguments I have heard in a long time on this website .
