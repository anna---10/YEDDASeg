TITLE: the atomic bombings of japan were morally justifiable

CATEGORY: Politics

It is correct that an invasion of Japan would have saved the lives of many soldiers and the most convenient thing to do was to destroy city after city until Japan was forced to surrender. In fact around that time destroying cities was a normal practice at the time and the British and Germans had done it to each other.
 
 So when it is very difficult to win a war by purely military means is it acceptable to start slaughtering civilians? It can be argued that such action can save military lives and win wars. However this is exactly the reasoning of Al Quaeda. They justify the killing of innocent civilians by claiming that it will help them win.
 
 I agree with the critics of Al Quaeda when I say that attacking innocent civilians is pure cowardice and it is wrong for people with guns to start slaughtering men women and children without them.
 
 The same goes for our actions in the Pacific. Yes, killing hundreds of thousands of civilians helped us win but no such action is not morally acceptable. Killing innocents never is. The only possible justification for this is that their government did not have the same high ideals and could conquer us.
 
 However, at the time we had their island surrounded and cut off from all resources. They had only a few subs and ships left and were producing practically nothing. They had no chance against us.
