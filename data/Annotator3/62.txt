TITLE: Should international law overthrow abortion?

CATEGORY: Politics

It doesn't matter if the life of the mother is important. Baby first, mother second. Everyday problems shouldn't determine a unborn's fate. Come on, man. Why use everyday problems to determine a unborn's fate? Poverty, hunger, crime, suffering doesn't determine whether the unborn will live. Only the Lord Jesus Christ determines who lives or who dies, not man. Maximum amount of children should not determine the unborn's fate. The life of the baby is more important than the mother. Animals risk their lives to protect their young, and humans should do the same. That justification for abortion will only cause embarrassment and disappointment. Let me ask you this. Are you saying adults' lives are more important than babies? Don't you and pro-choice have any sense of decency? Letting adults' lives be higher than an infant. Remember, the infant should be placed above everyone in the family. It is sinful to use justification for murder. The Lord Jesus Christ will rule on their behalf and judge those who carelessly murdered their unborn. When judgement day comes, you will give that justification to the Lord. Murdering an unborn only provokes His wrath. Justice will be brought for the unborn. Tell that to the Lord Jesus Christ. Lord Jesus Christ won't take any justification for murder neither will me and pro-life take that excuse. There is no excuse.
