TITLE: The great filter is ahead of us but we are destined to surpass it.

CATEGORY: Science

I read every argument three times over to be exactly sure what my opposition is trying to communicate.
 
 1) Ok, I just wanted to be sure on that.
 
 2) I was saying "but what if WE didn't exist? "
 
 3) Yes, But my point was, No matter what problems we face, Smart people will always find a solution.
 
 4) As for inaccurate, No, As for bias, Here let me provide you with another example if you do not trust that one.
 First, Lets see if I was inaccurate: Can you hardly compare the new UK to the old UK? The old UK dominated so much of the world to the point where the sun still hasn't set on the British empire (currently only due to a small island with a population of less than a hundred people). So what if their ancestry was from other countries? Thats what makes America so diverse!
 Second, Here's another example. China got overpopulated and large portions of people left, Eventually finding the island of japan and settling there in 660 B. C. Another, More modern example, Would be South Korea. They were suffering under oppression, So they formed their own nation. Just because a nation is similar (like America to UK, Japan to China, South Korea to North Korea) does not mean that they aren't entirely new nations. Overpopulation, Prosecution, And oppression were problems solved by forming new nations. Don't you think that we could solve much more?
 
 5) Dinosaurs were not intelligent life forms, So they were doomed to end once they faced a big problem (whatever you think that might have been). Life may be full of challenges, But there will always be people who are willing to combat those challenges.
 
 No hard feelings my friend?
