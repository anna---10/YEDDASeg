TITLE: Racial profiling is not always racist

CATEGORY: Politics

Racial profiling is not always racist. For instance, it is generally true that ethnic minorities tend to fill the lower end of the socio-economic scale. Poorer individuals are more likely to seek black market opportunities for income, and criminal behavior because of financial pressures in their life. To perceive a muslim traveller from a Muslim country harboring terrorists and to associate his ethnicity with terrorists of the same ethnicity does not imply a prejudice. Rather, it may be entirely necessary to acknowledge that certain societal and cultural factors make one statistically more likely to be associated with such groups. Regardless of the discomfort of perceived injustice felt be the searched individual, this kind of profiling actually ensures that other individuals like them aren't able to go hide in the fabric of their subculture to commit crimes.
