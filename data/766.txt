TITLE: Should same-sex marriage get banned?

CATEGORY: Politics

How will society ever evolve if we're always following by old traditions, or practicing something that is more common than another? The notion that banning same-sex marriage simply because an old book said so, is absurd. Your arguments are inferring that same-sex marriage should be banned because it, "offends God" and there is no way to procreate between same sexes. Where is the inclusion of the many people that don't want to have children, or can't have children? What if these same people were attracted to the same gender?
 
 How is loving someone of the opposite sex, different to loving someone of the same sex? These two 'spectrums' both fall under the subject of love.
 
 There is no evidence that supports your argument that marriage has only been performed with a male and a woman since the beginning of our civilisation. To prove your point wrong, homosexuality has been "around" for thousands of thousands of years, not to mention the Greek poet, Sappho.
