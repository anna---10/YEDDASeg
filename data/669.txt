TITLE: Should lobbying be abolished?

CATEGORY: Politics

With all due respect, Constituents dealing with the DOE for decades have been told for years they were 'must' hire a lobbyist. Not only are the lobbyists questionable, but their relationships with government employees at the DOE is also questionable. And if the DOE's own IG dept. claims they are being "stonewalled' by their own department leadership there is a huge problem between lobbyists and the DOE grant programs.
 
 Appreciate you supporting lobbyists (you might be one) but lobbying should be abolished immediately due to their undue influence of government employees providing federal grants going to universities and the incestuous ex-government employees relationships in private industry receiving those grants.
 
 "However the validity of these professional lobbyist is not what is up for debate lobbyist are providing a high value service." Really? Lobbyists should not be allowed to lobby to add one sentences to one paragraph in an 'existing' out-dated Congressional Mandate. There is no value there.
 
 When DOE government employees cannot change one simple paragraph in an admittedly outdated mandate that they have been made aware of by government grant recipients as well as private industry for a decade a lobbyist should not be needed and the government employee needs to be fired. In private industry that government employee would have been terminated. Instead the DOE leadership has had their jobs for the last decade creating university research grant jobs but nothing for the private sector.
