TITLE: The Two Party System is Best for America

CATEGORY: Politics

There are some things that I will need to correct for the young lad here. He says that "There are many different ideologies that are possible that are not the ideologies of the GOP and DNC." Well, you are wrong. You see, the GOP and the DNC were built on different principles and ideologies. In order to know which party you have the same ideologies as, you must first look at the Basic issues like Abortion, Gay Marriage, the Economy, Education, etc. In the House, the Senate, even the White House, the party allows you to differentiate in a bill. Example, the Democrats and the Republicans supported the Keystone Pipeline XL, but President Obama, who is a Democrat, vetoed the bill. The Political Party does not pursue you because of issues that aren't major, but the ones that the party is built upon.
 
 "The GOP and the DNC are too similar"
 It's very funny that you would say that. Yes, every party is the same in some way, but like I said earlier, what makes a political party differ is the principles that they were built upon.
 
 "Our founding fathers said so"
 You are right, the founding fathers warned us, but they did not do anything to prevent it. Is it in the Consitution? No. Did they make a law or Amendment to prevent us from doing so? No. The founding fathers would have done something to prevent this if they thought of it to be a bad thing, but they didn't. Why? Because they know for a fact that they wanted this, but couldn't support it because of the times they were in. Abraham Lincoln found the Republican Party. His time and President Adams times changed. Now, Lincoln can actually support and create a political party in which Adams couldn't.
