TITLE: Should Juveniles Be Tried and Treated as Adults?

CATEGORY: Society

As courts in the United States allow juveniles as young as 10 years old to be tried as adults and placed in adult prison, my argument is based on the premise that 10-18 year old juveniles who commit crimes are not to be tried as adults nor placed in adult prisons.
 
 I do not believe that juveniles should be tried or treated as adults. Simply because a person has the capability to do something does not mean they have all the mental awareness necessary to understand what the consequences of their actions are. You state "if the juvenile had the mental capacity...", how are you defining "if" and what constitutes mental capacity? In other words, how do you determine that the juvenile did have the mental capacity to commit the crime?
 
 Again, though juveniles presumably know the difference between right and wrong that does not mean they do the "right" thing all the time any more than it means an adult does. They also do not have the mental capacity to determine the consequence for their actions nor do they necessarily have the ability to fight their impulses. You state that "juveniles already have an idea...", what do you mean by "idea"? Is having an idea of right and wrong the same as having concrete understanding of right and wrong? You then say "regardless, the young adult already knew which category that it would fit in"; are you then saying that all young adults know the difference between right and wrong?
 
 Lastly, you imply the prison system is punishment. I assume you are referring to adult prison. Is not the purpose of prison to rehabilitate and not punish?
