TITLE: Is the (Jewish) Bible Against Woman Rights?

CATEGORY: Society

"Women were regarded as property because they held such a high value based on their beauty and intellect."
 Went Abram went with Sarai to Egypt, the Egyptians sinned, and got plagues. Wanna know why? Cause they sinned. What was there sin? Just only caring about her looks and not the leader she was. I'll give you where this is from, but you wont find this because it's not straight from translation, but commentaries I don't know how to find
 Bereishit - Genesis - Chapter 13
 
 Ok, quotes mean very little, but it is better than no evidence. I would like to see your evidence for:
 A) "It is against women rights because women were born into this world by God for three reasons; cook, clean and make babies."
 B) "They have come to this truth after years of study under the one true God that constantly calls us back and forgives us for treating women as people rather than property. This is purely a Jewish point of view."
 
 Also, try adding a little more.
