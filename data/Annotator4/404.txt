TITLE: The Us should raise th minimum wage to 15 dollars per hour.

CATEGORY: Economics

I apologize for the forfeit and wil ltry to make it up this round.  
  
   My arguments are...
  
  
  
    As shown here     http://www.usnews.com...     many people need to have low paying jobs to start off with as businesses eliminate jobs to accomodate for the extra spending.  
  
      Minimum wage hikes will eliminate jobs.     https://www.epionline.org...     A minimum wage hike would reduce the amount of jobs and pro’s claim of the 1968 minimum wage is invalid since this study shows that accounting for inflation the minimum wage would’ve been $4.    Also, do teenagers or really anyone really need 30,000 dollars a year for flipping burgers?     http://www.investopedia.com...      http://thesovereigninvestor.com...          In conclusion a minimum wage increase would lower the amount of jobs in America. It would make businesses lay off jobs and it would help some, but hurt many living on the current minimum wage and really hurt many living below it trying to work their way up.    A minimum wage hike would also only encourage businesses to move work overseas for more cheap labor.         Pro’s first paragraph suggests a $15 dollar minimum wage in third world countries though this debate is about the USA and that is completely outside the Us’ jurisdiction, those countries have their own governments. I believe I have also adequeately refuted pros points with my arguments partly since the unemployment increase would increase food stamps and welfare need because of the layed off jobs.
