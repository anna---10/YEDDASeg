TITLE: Drinking Age

CATEGORY: Politics

This fact is true but are lives also not lost on the battlefield of men and women who risk their lives for us at 18 and above? It is obviously irresponsible for people to drink and drive under the influence no matter what age. However if a person at 18 years old is willing to lay down his life for our freedom, why should he/she not be able to have a alcoholic beverage when they return home safely to their friends and families?
