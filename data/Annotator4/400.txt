TITLE: Nihilism is an ethical fallacy

CATEGORY: Society

My opponent seems to be, albeit circuitously, asserting that nihilism is an untenable ethical position. His assertion arises from a misunderstanding of nihilism as a moral and logical position. He has several claims, all in error. Considering the very small character limit, I will respond in my favored method:
 
 >> "Nihilism claims that life is a meaningless sentence"
 
 Actually, nihilism claims that there is no intrinsic meaning in life. By it's very nature, nihilists could not proscribe life as a "sentence" because that would import a negative meaning to something they hold meaningless. This doesn't mean that nihilism is a contradictory proposition - it means you have mischaracterized it.
 
 >> "Life is the height of reality, for it is quite literally all we know. To so easily dismiss all that we have experienced... as not real... is to betray the very value of life itself"
 
 HUGE problem here. Nihilism is not anti-realist, although there are some that hold it to be true that there *could* be a *possible* universe with no concrete objects. Nihilism does not hold that objects and experiences are not real - it just holds that they do not have intrinsic meaning.
 
 >> [Nihilism is] "taking a view on existence from a purview that allows for no happiness, no contentment, no joy, and no life."
 
 Well obviously life is immediately disqualified, as you have to be alive to be a nihilist. The question then becomes if you can generate happiness, contentment, and joy via a meaningless medium. Take for example a sunset - the particular arrangement of photons that we see carries no meaning whatsoever. However, it is still capable of producing feelings of joy, contentment, happiness etc... The knowledge that events are random or that arrangements are meaningless does not destroy the feelings associated with that phenomenon.
 
 >> [Nihilism] "betrays all morality"
 
 Unless you re a non-cognitivist.
 
 NEGATED.
