TITLE: Abortion should be illegal save for a threat to the mother's life.

CATEGORY: Politics

"Very early abortion: Since it is alive (even though relatively small), it should be illegal."
 
 I mean the first question is why? The other more important point is that pro didn't even seek to address my main point with this which was that allowing early abortion will help to reduce later abortion. This is because it provides an easy option for termination early within the pregnancy preventing desperate resorts later on. Part of the reason that this should be allowed is that in countries that have banned abortion there is no statistically significant change in the rate of abortion and as a result of this in order to counter abortion later where the increased development of the baby, the ability for it to feel pain and the relative consciousness they experience.
 
 "No chance of Survival: If there is even a 1% chance, it is immoral to reduce it to 0%."
 
 Right but often here we're talking about cases where the child is already dead or has zero chance of survival which was made clear by my argument.
