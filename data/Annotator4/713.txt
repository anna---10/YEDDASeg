TITLE: Government should be laissez faire

CATEGORY: Politics

Please excuse my super late reply, my internet is faulty. Also, please be nice. No one is trying to spear you with opinions and/or questioning your intellect so there's no need to be snippy. Its okay to have a strong opinion, but not to be rude about it.
 
 When I say Laissez faire, I'm referring mainly to economics. A free market makes the most efficient use of resources, and it avoids people becoming reliant on state support, which encourages creativity and growth. Unrestricted capitalism means that those who make the best decisions about what products and services to offer will flourish, while those who make bad decisions will fail. It's also argued that without government interventions, how resources are used is decided by the way people choose to spend their money, thus increasing efficiency overall. These arguments work on the logic that the combined actions of the public, each acting from self-interest make for more effective economic decisions than a central government can make. Personally, I think that government being completely hands off would be great, but like you've pointed out, basics (like roads) would be crappy and essentially useless. I do think that communities would benefit from their own system of police work, which would vary from group to group. Trade and commerce between groups would be an available option and probably happily used.
