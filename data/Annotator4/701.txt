TITLE: If you don't vote, you don't have a right to complain.

CATEGORY: Politics

Hello,
 
 Good post, I was just talking to someone about this actually.
 
 Here I go :
 
 People that vote definitely have the right to complain. If they voted for "X" person and "Y" person won, they should have a chance to complain about what happened because they didn't like the outcome anyways.
 
 Someone that doesn't vote, shouldn't be able to say anything. If they have a problem with what is going on after the vote, then they should have voted to try and stop what happened.
 
 It is as simple as that.
 
 Vote, so you can complain when something goes wrong.
 I must say though, if you voted for "X" person and they won, then you DO NOT have a right to complain about what's going on.
 
 Thanks and good luck!
