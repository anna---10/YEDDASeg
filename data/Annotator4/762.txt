TITLE: Should brazil be given more credit for ther work in World war2 than most us and world history gives

CATEGORY: Society

I believe that Brazil is given all of the credit that it deserves.
 
 I also would like to say how a country receives credit for its role in WWII. A country receives credit for playing an important role in WWII by standing out more than others. In Brazil, I'm sure they talk about Brazil's role. In other countries it is different.
 
 I believe that the USSR and China do not receive enough credit for their role in WWII even though they were important.
 
 Anyway, I await Pro's arguments.
