TITLE: More people with guns will help stop the criminals from abusing them.

CATEGORY: Politics

I would like to start my rebuttal with this, my opponent can list what other countries have done to support his case I can not and would not if what I propose was at work in some other country because America is a whole different country then any other in history; it can not be compared to other countries, because the situation is very different then any other and in my opinion better(overall). But I will leave you with this, "In 1985 before the gun ban in Japan they only suffered 10 gun related murders with hunting guns that year."[1]
 
 The only reason Japan could ban all guns anyway is because its a constitutional monarchy they do not believe in having freedoms that we do and did not use democracy as the foundation of there country. I hope a complete gun ban is not an option for my opponent or any one else out there because it is not constitutional and takes freedom out of America.
 
 What I can do though is list the numerous statistics that prove households with guns in America are safer and have less violent crimes.
 
 Firstly, I start with this quote from justfacts.com which says, "A 1993 nationwide survey of 4,977 households found that over the previous five years, at least 3.5% of households had members who had used a gun "for self-protection or for the protection of property at home, work, or elsewhere." Applied to the U.S. population, this amounts to 1,029,615 such incidents per year. This figure excludes all "military service, police work, or work as a security guard."[2]
 
 Second, "Based on survey data from a 2000 study published in the Journal of Quantitative Criminology,[17] U.S. civilians use guns to defend themselves and others from crime at least 989,883 times per year.[18]"[2]
 
 Third, "A 1994 survey conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that Americans use guns to frighten away intruders who are breaking into their homes about 498,000 times per year.[20]"[2]
 
 Fourth, "A 1982 survey of male felons in 11 state prisons dispersed across the U.S. found:[21]
 
 " 34% had been "scared off, shot at, wounded, or captured by an armed victim"
 " 40% had decided not to commit a crime because they "knew or believed that the victim was carrying a gun"
 69% personally knew other criminals who had been "scared off, shot at, wounded, or captured by an armed victim"[22]"[2]
 
 And lastly your own source factcheck.org lists these numbers here, "in 2010 there were 11,078 gun related murders the lowest since 1985, while gun ownership was at its highest 88.8%. This source also notes a drop in gun robberies and aggravated assault while manufacturing also went up."[3]
 
 Of course we should in fact take more precautionary measures like back round checks and safety classes and maybe even mandatory gun locks opened by a password when a house has minors. If all this was accomplished what I said here and in my last segment, I guarantee that it would cut down gun murders and violence.
 
 I wish that in that school in Connecticut when the first gunshot was heard that one of the teachers could have gotten out there handgun told those beautiful children don't worry I've got you and taken down that terrible man. same thing in Colorado or in these many other shootings.
 
 I will end with this, I know that most of the people reading this like me believe in the way are country was founded, we know how smart those founding fathers were, how much they loved and protected this country, how they fought for this country, how they believed in this country, and how when they wrote that Bill of Right, the second amendment of the constitution they knew putting "the Right to Bear Arms" was in the best interest of the protection and freedom of the people and America the great free state.
 
 Not the wrote to go hunt with guns, not the right to own guns as antiques, but the right to bear them for protection.
