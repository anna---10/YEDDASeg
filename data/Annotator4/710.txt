TITLE: Diabetes is preventable and curable.

CATEGORY: Science

The research paper doesn't involve dietary considerations in the analysis. Therefore, the analysis is faulty and biased.
 Note -
 Diabetes research facilities have to create false assumptions in order to get funding for their research to justify their huge budgets and expenditure on equipment and wages. Diabetes research foundations are a huge waste of time and money and cost the community billions of dollars. The cause and cure of diabetes is already known. The research facilities have to pretend that they don't know what the cause and cure for diabetes is. They proceed with arrogance and authority to quote complicated solutions which involve the use of drugs as a means of combating the chemical imbalances. They look for genetic mutations to justify their research. It is true that genetic mutations occur in all individuals but this is not the cause of any type of diabetes. Once you remove the sugar, grain and dairy from a person's diet, then, the diabetic symptoms will disappear. The question needs to asked - does the research facility take into account a person's diet in their analysis? Answer - Never.
