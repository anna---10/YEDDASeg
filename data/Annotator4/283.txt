TITLE: Arguments for and against Democracy.

CATEGORY: Politics

Alright, I will try to follow the same format, though I'm going to categorize my points.
 
    Voters in a democratic system might not make the best choice or the choice that truly best represents society's best interests, due to:  
    Being irrational in general.   
    Advertising influence of a disproportionately wealthy upper class (think campaign funding in the US - voters are very easily influenced by campaigns).   
    Being more concerned with their own well-being instead of the overall well-being of everyone.   
    Not considering the long-term outcomes of decisions that improve conditions in the short term, possibly creating a difficult situation for future generations.      
    Democracy often results in tyranny by majority, since a majority could blockade any measure intended to serve minority interests.   
    Minorities may 'give up' on democracy, not voting due to the fact that their votes essentially do nothing unless more people agree with them.   
    Democracies most often lend themselves to a small number of parties, where voters either have to conform to one group's values, ignore some of their own values in order to conform, or simply not participate in elections.   
    Pure democracies are very slow and inefficient, since it takes a lot of time to count and recount referendums.   
    Tyranny by majority is as bad or worse than dictatorship.
