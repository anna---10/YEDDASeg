TITLE: The societal wisdom of Socialism is undeniable.

CATEGORY: Politics

To be honest, I think you've made my argument for me.
 
 I can point to the gilded age, to the squalor of the factories, the burned bodies in Bangladesh, the suicides in China, and no matter what I say, you'll just endorse the people responsible.
 
 You've said greed is good, Jesus is bad, equality is immoral, and that the rich can do whatever they want with the poor.
 
 Really I don't have to say anything else. You've come across as a caricature, like the Monopoly Man came to life in front of everyone. You've just proved me right, very vividly.
 
 Further, you've also done a fantastic deed for me. You've effectively announced that one cannot be a Capitalist and a Christian, and I hope some of the billions of Christians will pay attention to that.
