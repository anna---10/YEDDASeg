Maple syrup. Ice hockey. Niceness. The "Canadian Tuxedo". Yes, Canada is famous for many, many things "" and yet somehow we still feel under appreciated next to our great North American neighbor and Britain . Therefore I state that CANADA is still better for many reasons in the following:
 
 We live longer: Canadians born today will live an average of three years longer than Americans (81 years in Canada versus 78.7 south of the border)
 
 We"re more satisfied with our lives: According to the Better Life Index, an international quality of life comparison by the OECD each year, Canadians enjoy a higher level of life satisfaction than Americans, scoring 7.4 out of 10, versus 7.0 in the U.S.
 
 We have better work-life balance: More than 11 per cent of U.S. employees regularly clock 50-hour workweeks, compared to 3.9 per cent here.
 
 We brave the cold better: Our climate is colder and our population smaller, but relatively fewer of us succumb to the cold. Where Canada has 5,644 excess winter deaths (relative to average non-winter deaths), the U.S. sees 108,500.
 
 CANADA has the longest country in any of the world with 151,600 miles.
 
 CANADA contains 9 percent of the worlds freshwater population.
 
 CANADA is the second largest continent in the world.
 
 CANADA is sweet by nature.
 
 Happy Canada Day, Canadians! While you get hopped up on Labbatt's and McCain oven chips, we're celebrating it in the most British way possible: by putting ourselves down in a self-deprecating manner.
 
 The Canadian flag has foliage on it.
 
 The British flag has no foliage on it.
