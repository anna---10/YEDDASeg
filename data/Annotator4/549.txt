TITLE: It is Likely there will be a World Government in the Near Future

CATEGORY: Politics

Round 1 is for Acceptance.
 
 BoP is shared, I need to show why a World Government would arise, my opponent must show reasons to the opposite.
 
 Definitions:
 
 The Near Future shall be defined as within 300 years from now.
 
 Likely [1]
 1.probable: probably going to happen
 2.plausible: fit to be believed
 3.suitable: appropriate for a particular activity or purpose
 
 Another way to put it: which is more likely, establishment of a World Government or no establishment of a World Government?
 
 And by World Government I mean a one world country, without any holdout countries.
