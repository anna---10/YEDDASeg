TITLE: Can anyone successfully live off of only welfare programs?

CATEGORY: Politics

i was not saying that medicaid and Obamacare are the same thing, I am saying with his salary at his job he would qualify for Obamacare, meaning that your initial estimate for the money saved by using medicaid is wrong. Now for section 8 housing, on the link i provided, question 10 asks, "what is Imputed welfare income?"
 
 Now for your closing, it is flawed to say that one could live off of welfare because the number is so close to equal for both. And Tony is making about half the national average, so there are very few people who would fall into the same economic situation as Tony. It is also inaccurate to say that you have refuted all my claims when you have only refuted a few and incorrectly at that.
