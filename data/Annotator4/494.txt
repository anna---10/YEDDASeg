TITLE: gay marriage

CATEGORY: Society

Hi! I will start of by letting you I'm not gay. However, I do have gay friends. And how come you have a right to marry, yet they do not! Isn't America a free country? I think so. Because it's a free country, that means that gay people should have a right to get married just as much as a straight person has a right to get married.
