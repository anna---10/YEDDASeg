TITLE: Should the U.S. continue to take military action in the War on Terror?

CATEGORY: Politics

My opponent fails to understand the concept I was referring to. The War on Terror has not been effective, as proven by multiple headlines mentioned in my first speech. Moreover, he has not provided any headlines that show the war on terror is successful. On the other hand, I have provided multiple sources showing the relative ineffectiveness of the War on Terror. 
 
  It could be argued that Obama is also advocating for the ending of the War on Terror. If he is saying the war must end, this can be used in support of the Con position. This military action should be suspended. 
 
  In regards to al Qaeda, the death of bin Laden was a great success, but this has not been accompanied with the total removal of al Qaeda threats. Furthermore, new threats have come into portrayal. For example, ISIS and Boko Haram are more modern displays of insecurity. Therefore, instead of routing al Qaeda completely, the US has only weakened one group and arguably facilitated two new threats in the process. 
 
  Conclusively, my opponent has assisted my side by quoting our president, and dropped the following arguments: 
  The War on Terror is empirically ineffective 
  The War on Terror has yielded unseemly events 
  The Enemies are not adequately defined 
  The War on Terror Lacks US support to continue 
  Alternatives Would be more pragmatic solutions to the problems.
