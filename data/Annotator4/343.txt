Moral is defined as, concerned with the principles of right and wrong behavior and the goodness or badness of human character.

 I claim that dog fighting is just as bad or worse than factory farming.
 
 1. Factory farming makes more jobs than dogfighting. This is because it is so widespread and there is Moe demand for food than the entertainment of dogfights.

 2. Factory farming serves more purposes than dogfighting. Including food, money and jobs.

 3. Obviously less risk of debilitating injury is involved in factory farming than dogfighting since the dogs are used to fight and spill blood instead of make meat.

 4. It is a terrible form of Grammer to say something is more moral than something else. What is immoral is simply wrong. Either right or wrong you can't be more wrong or less wrong. Dogfighting is definitely immoral. However the benefits are obvious in factory farming.
 
 These are my arguments for this round. It should be obvious that factory farming benefits mankind more than dogfighting ever will. Therefore factory farming is either equal or "more moral" than dogfighting. I look forward to my opponents response.
