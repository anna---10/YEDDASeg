TITLE: Psychedelic drugs are irrationally criminalised and should be made legal

CATEGORY: Society

Many legal things are dangerous and should not be given to certain people. Take guns and alcohol for example. Also, I never stated that it should be given out freely. I do believe that it should be controlled and only given to mentally stable adults in reasonable amounts. There should obviously be rules and laws made to regulate responsible use of the drugs. However, why make it completely illegal? As long as it is being given to responsible, mentally stable adults without a criminal record, I do not understand the harm.
