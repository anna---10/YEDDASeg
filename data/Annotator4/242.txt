TITLE: Guns

CATEGORY: Politics

Guns have only one reason to exist: To kill.
    Even in protection, they are meant to kill. Is it worth a person's life, just to prevent a petty crime? Most criminals have their whole life in front of them, and can change.
 
 Other protection exists in life, for example pepper spray. Though it may be less effective in some situations, it is still safe. Having very little risk to long term accidental harm.
 
 Childhood accidents due to guns are a real problem. Nearly 1,300 children die due to guns a year.
 
 Also, having guns means we also have a culture of violence. Should we not work on non violent solutions to problems, just as well tell our children to do?
