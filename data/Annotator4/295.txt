TITLE: Allowing the World's Strongest superpowers to control the world will strengthen it.

CATEGORY: Politics

It is true that African slavery played an important role in the advancement of most European countries and the USA. To a larger extent,however, it was the innovation of the Europeans that won the day. For example, the Europeans designed new and better forms of infrastructure and then used African labour to construct the buildings. Never the less, technological advancements brought forward by the industrial revolution would render African labour useless hence the abolition of slavery had a very trivial impact on European economy and industry. If the LEDCs in Africa and other continents had the same intellectual power possesed by the MEDCs they would be able to implement the best possible strategies to utilise their resources and refurbish the current position of international trade. Furthermore, it is an undisputed fact that the post colonial period showed that African countries are unable to cater for themselves. For instance, after the Southern African country Zimbabwe gained independence in 1980 , it had a stronger economy than China; the Zimbabwean dollar was comparable to the British pound. Zimbabwe had become the "bread-basket of Africa" as a result of British leadership. As fate would have it, Zimbabwe became independent and the African leaders who took control sank the ship,so to speak. In 2008, hyper-inflation rendered the Zim dollar void. This is simply an archetype of the atrocities that befall some countries without leadership of some innovative countries. In the face of this overwhelming evidence, one can easily see that the debate has been won in the favour of the affirmative delegation.
