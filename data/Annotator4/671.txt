CATEGORY: Politics

a background check law and they see your latest actions your stability to own a weapon a gun safety test i should know i had to go through all test before i could buy my weapons to protect myself from are corrupt government i think banning assault rifles and banning high cap mags will do nothing anyone can murder someone with a knife the same day as the Newtown shooting a man brought a knife in and killed 17 kids we need more help with mental health more cuts from are blind government are taking place in mental facilities banning guns wont help you can easily get full automatic weapons on the street than in a store you guys say a machine guns assault rifles we need more protection on gun control thats not the problem in columbine all there guns were bought illegally i own ar-15s which all you liberals call an M16 there completely different ones only semi automatic and the m16 is fully automatic you liberals dont know the difference you think banding guns will solve the problem its extremely hard to get guns in in California yet the crime rate is extremely high a kid in my town was murdered by an illegal tech 9 which was fully automatic with the serial numbers removed impossible to get in my state legally so explain to me how banning guns is going to help its mental health we need help with an assault weapon is a fully automatic weapon this government has changed i around to the point of where if the clip has 30 round in it its an assault weapon thats not it machine guns are already banned an AR-15 is not a machine gun an MG-42 fully automatic german made LMG is a machine gun which is already banned. the hardest thing is to get a full automatic weapon in the united states you have to get certain permits aka a C3 license they are impossible to get in many states and you have to pay a tax stamp and go through a week long process to get it and in many states longer than a week and the mom of the Newtown shooter didn't own an ar-15 he murdered those kids with pistols everyone needs to know there facts before debating them
