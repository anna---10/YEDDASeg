TITLE: The Nationwide Legalization of Marijuana

CATEGORY: Society

The article was actually very unbiased. Here's another one  http://www.washingtontimes.com...  . I am not saying that crime will be gone totally, but I am saying that overall crime will lessen. It's impossible for me to say that there will be no crime. Yes there will be crime, but much less. Aside from crime, what about all of the tax revenue from pot?? think of all the money that is lost because the government cannot get there hands on it. You live in colorado, so you probably know that Colorado had over 70 million dollars in tax revenue last year because of pot. How can you say that this is not good? America could get so much done with that amount of money.
