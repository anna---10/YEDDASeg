TITLE: Racial Profiling Allows Certain Criminals to Get Away and Promotes Discrimination

CATEGORY: Society

No problem. It's understandable. 
 
 
 The problem with racial profiling is that it creates a "profile" of a criminal. The profile also fits countless innocent people. It is discriminatory and unfair for the innocent who outnumber the criminals. Criminals come in many shapes and sizes. That is how racial profiling lets many criminals get away. Those who don't fit the profile slip through the cracks. Many criminals are clever and know the strategy of racial profiling. 
 
 The kind of racial profiling I'm speaking of was defined in the first round. That is the type of profiling I am speaking out against. 
 
 Another issue with racial profiling is that it gives people the mindset that only certain types of people commit crimes. That certainly is not true. It causes racial tension in communities. The races that are targeted feel oppressed and unwelcome. 
 
 Thus, I still hold the view that racial profiling lets certain criminals go away. I gave a source an example of this. I also think that the meaning of racial profiling has its roots in discrimination as defined in the first round. I don't view that definition as misleading. It accurately represents how racial profiling works. My source from the civil rights page also explains how racial profiling has failed to make the nation safer.  http://www.civilrights.org...
