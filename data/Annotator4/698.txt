TITLE: Gun Control Laws Do More Harm Than Good

CATEGORY: Politics

Us citizens, cannot always do as we are asked. (Why are you focusing on Obama here? Obama is not the care taker of the gun). If you own a gun,of course, you should always put it in a safe place, it is your responsibility , but whoever said everyone listens. A survey ,(first link below), showed 31.1% say they don't feel safe with the fact that there is gun violence in schools. Now,don't even start with saying,"self defense". A recent study,(second link),proved that a 1995 study had fairly different results than the recent study. The 1995 study said over 2.5 million guns were used as self defense as the recent study said guns were used 0.00852% of the time for self defense.
