TITLE: Is globalization key to humanities long term survival as a species?

CATEGORY: Politics

The Internet is arguably the most impactful invention of all time. It allows instant communication across the globe and allows people to experience and partake in events that otherwise would have never been possible. Ignorance on world events becomes more of a choice in developed countries due to the access of information. Humanity is a highly self destructive species and when it comes to the grand scheme of things we are so busy fighting amongst ourselves that we are practically helpless when it comes to outside extinction level events. Humans as a social species are far stronger when unified then when not. So I argue that globalization is the only hope that humanity has at long term survival in a dangerous universe. Good luck to my opponent and I look forward to hearing your argument.
