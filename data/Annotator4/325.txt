TITLE: gun control

CATEGORY: Politics

alright as affirmative (pro) requested i will leave cross examination till the last round
 
 since last round i talked about crime rate this round i will talk about employment and government
 
 First off there are many people who support there family with these guns they hunt with them and use them for sport to gain money and food for there family
 
 the unemployment rate is already low enough do we also wanna take away the jobs of all those people who own or work in a gun shop
 
 So many people make a living with these guns our unemployment rate is gonna spike
 
 ok now its time for my government section
 
 as the people we are supposed to be ready to fight if the government uses any act of tyranny against us the people this may be unlikely but lets take a look at this
 
 - The Soviet Union established gun control and from 1929 to 1953 about 20 million dissidents were exterminated
 
 - In 1935 Germany established gun control and 13 million Jews unable to defend themselves were killed
 
 - China established gun control in 1935 and from 1948 to 1952 20 million political dissidents were exterminated
 
 These were all acts of tyranny from there forms of government
