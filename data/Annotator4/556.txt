TITLE: US Military Intervention in Mexico & Other Countries of Latin America

CATEGORY: Politics

The reason for using the US military to integrate and intervene in many parts of Latin America is simple. There countries are causing numerous American deaths and therefore an intervention is practical if we use the same protocol used in the attacks on the twin towers and Pentagon on September 11, 2001. Only 3, 000 US civilians were killed on the attack, And that was more than enough to grant an advanced and coordinated invasion into Iraq.
 The Cartels and other Latin American gangs are causing far more than 3, 000 US civillian deaths every year. It is estimated that since 2006, There have been 150, 000 coordinated homicides by the cartels of Latin America. America maintains its conflict in the middle East even though since the years following 9/11 only 95 US civilians have been killed by islamic extremist groups. Using basic math and history, We can easily conclude that a coordinated intervention into Latin America would be justified, Practical, And ethical.
