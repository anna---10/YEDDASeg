TITLE: Should Asylum Seekers be Welcomed?

CATEGORY: Society

From reading your past arguments, I have come to the conclusion that you might mean immigrants? Aren't they virtually the same thing in a way? But you aren't understanding what I was saying, I was saying that most people should be let in, while others are turned away. Like as another example, a man wants to seek asylum in the United States, he has been known to associate with terror groups, he is being hunted down by maybe Germany, or China. Would you let him in? I get what you are saying, like let a majority of people in, and keep criminals out. I agree with you there. But say a flood of people are seeking asylum in the country of Romonovia, from the country of Sconeistan(I've come up with that name as it is the thing I'm eating right now), they have been known to be avid readers of the "Sconeistan Tribune" it is a anti-Romonovian newspaper, would you let them in as they have probably been exposed to anti-state propaganda. When mass amounts are seeking asylum would you let all of them in? You wouldn't be able to do back-round checks on all of them. So its best not to let everyone seeking asylum in.
