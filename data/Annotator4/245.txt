TITLE: gay marriage does not lead to bestiality or pedophilia marriages

CATEGORY: Society

I don't believe by making homosexual marriage legal that it will lead to the legalization of pedophilia or bestiality marriages. Children and animals cannot consent to marriage or sex, therefore, the argument that gay marriage will lead to these things is absurd.
