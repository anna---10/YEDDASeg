TITLE: Women should not be punished for sunbathing topless.

CATEGORY: Society

Though the UN is free to pass resolutions on any topic they choose, the recent history of those resolutions and their efficacy is sketchy at best. Consider UN resolutions and sanctions regarding Iran and North Korea. These actions have failed to substantially change the policies of these regimes. UN resolutions have been notorious historically for their impotence, and principles of individual liberties and local sovereignty dictate, and rightly so, that the UN have no substantial power to influence or direct policies of member nations.
 
 Without a substantial shift in the authority and mission of the UN, my opponent's conclusion cannot be implemented.
 
 My many regards to my opponent for his thoughtful topic!
