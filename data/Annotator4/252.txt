TITLE: Should animal testing be banned?

CATEGORY: Science

In my opinion, humans have a significantly higher level of intelligence, and thus it is acceptable to experiment on animals.
 
 To back my argument, I would like to quote the California Biomedical Research Association: "Every medical breakthrough in the last 100 years have resulted directly from animal testing. If people are against animal testing, why have they not suggested adequate alternatives? Even though computer models are reasonable alternatives, animal testing is still necessary for modelling the programs. Testing on cell or tissue cultures do not provide the opportunity to observe the movement of drugs/medicines throughout different systems, such as the circulatory systems, and conditions such as blindness or high blood pressure do not manifest in single-cell organisms.
 
 I would also like to draw attention to the fact that animal testing is necessary where potential toxicity is being tested. For example, thalidomide caused birth defects in human beings and was not properly tested on pregnant animals. Would you rather save the life of a human, with a lifespan of approximately 80 years, or a mouse, whose lifespan lasts about 2 years?
 
 While on the topic of lifespan, humans take centuries to have multiple generations. Assuming that the lifespan of a human and a mouse last 80 and 2 years each, a mouse can spawn 39 generations of mice in 1 human generation. This is important when it comes to studying the passing down of drug effects. This very fact has helped oncologists understand cancer better.
 
 Therefore, I feel that animal testing is justified and should not be banned, but endorsed instead.
