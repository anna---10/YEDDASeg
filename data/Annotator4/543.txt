I would like to thank lannan13 for being kind enough to allow me to finish this debate (fourth time lucky?).
 
  Economy 
 
 We know the economics of prohibition. We know that when a substance is prohibited the economy takes a hit [1]. This will reduce the standard of living for the populous as a whole. 
 
  Human Freedom 
 
 I would like to know what my opponent thinks gives him the right to regulate what a person does to their own body in the privacy of their own home.
 
  Lowers Drug Addiction 
 
 Under almost every example of legalisation drug consumption goes down, this is because in countries where drugs are legalised there is not legal pressure not to come forward as an addict and because of this in countries where drugs are legalised more addicts get treatment [2].
