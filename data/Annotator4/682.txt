TITLE: Are there more than two genders?

CATEGORY: Society

I actually have yet to meet an agender or genderfluid person who has that lifestyle just for attention. I never said a person would naturally identify as something idiotic as a toaster or chair. Sure, people would do things to seek attention, but only a very small percentage would seek attention by faking their gender identity. I for one should know that gender identity is not an attention seeking choice mostly because I am genderfluid myself and never in the time it took to realize this aspect about myself did it cross my mind of how much attention I would attract. It was a part of me that I have chosen to express.
