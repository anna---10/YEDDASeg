TITLE: In Britain, men are discriminated against more than women.

CATEGORY: Society

My Arguments 
 
  #1: The right to financial abortion 
 
 Men do not have the right to a financial abortion in cases where they are unable to/don't want to provide for their child [1], whereas if a woman is unable to/doesn't want to provide for a child, she can have an abortion [2].
 
  #2: The Cancer funding gap 
 
  Prostate cancer gets under half the amount of funding that breast cancer gets [3], as pointed out by Prostate Cancer UK. Although it is one of the more treatable types of cancer, particularly if diagnosed early, one man dies every hour from it, says Prostate Cancer UK. 
 
  #3: The Domestic violence shelter gap  
 
 Despite the fact that 40% of domestic violence victims are men [4], and that when you factor in suicides, more men die as a result of it [5], there is approximately only one domestic violence shelter for men for every 180 there is for women [6].
 
 I'll leave it there for now.
 
 Thank you.
