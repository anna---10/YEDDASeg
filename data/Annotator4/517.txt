TITLE: Gay students should have gay schools with no judgement

CATEGORY: Society

Thanks, Pro.
 
 -------------------------------------------------------
 
 The resolution of this debate is that: " Gay students should have gay schools with no judgement" . Pro clarifies what he means by this in his first round: " A gay student should be in a gay or gay friendly school to avoid bullying or harrassment" . Pro has the burden of proof in this debate, because he is advocating for a change in the status-quo; he is advocating for the development of "gay" schools or "gay friendly" schools. Thus, in order to win this debate, I am tasked with successfully negating the arguments he gives to support his position. Note that I do  not  have to provide positive arguments of my own, in order to win this debate, even though it may be beneficial.
 
 --Pro's Case--
 
 Pro's justification for "gay" schools, or "gay friendly" schools essentially resolves around gay students having a "better life"; one with "no oppression", and that it ["gay" schools/"gay friendly" schools] "is best for straight-gay equality or gay freedom". His proposal is flawed for a simple reason, which I shall discuss quickly. 
 
 Pro's proposal only deals with the symptoms of gay oppression, whilst ignoring the underlying causes. This is because even though there may be less gay oppression at "gay" schools, or "gay friendly" schools were his proposal were to be implemented, this still does not deal with the problems relating to gays in regard to society at large. With his proposal, a significant proportion of society will nevertheless remain hostile toward gays, because his proposal does not deal with underlying issues revolving to gays within society.
 
 --Conclusion--
 
 The resolution is negated.
