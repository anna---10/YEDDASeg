TITLE: Should we end smoking?

CATEGORY: Society

My argument is quite simple. I believe people have authority over their own bodies, and if they so choose to, they have the right to smoke whatever they wish, granted that they don't blow the smoke intentionally in other people's faces to harm them. Otherwise, it is not Pro's place or mine to dictate what one should or should not do to their own bodies. We do not have such authority, and indeed, even the government should not be able to prohibit behaviors that does not harm anyone but the consenting individual upon his own body, given that the said individual is fully aware and responsible adult that can think and act for himself.
 
 I look forward to Pro's argument.
