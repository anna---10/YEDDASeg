TITLE: Gene Therapy (Use)

CATEGORY: Science

Being a relatively new area in medical research, the current knowledge of gene therapy is not enough to consider it safe and effective. There have been many nightmare cases in which gene therapy created new symptoms and ultimately resulted in the death of people. Some cancers and disorders are just not able to be cured through this. Although short term, drug therapy is a tried and tested method and therefore is deemed safer. The way gene therapy works is that a virus with the correct and non-defective genes is injected into this person (1). This in itself is a major problem. The virus, in many cases, would be rejected by the body because it would be detected as a foreign body. Once rejected, the body will fight it off more aggressive next time and all of the times after that. This calls in to question the true effectiveness of gene therapy. Another alternative and rarely used type of gene therapy is using naked DNA. Not only could it be attacked, but its ability to rapidly divide uncontrollably would cause more problems then without it. There was a story about a boy named Jesse Gelinger. He suffered from a rare metabolic disorder called OTC, or ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency. He had to take 32 drugs daily for this disorder. He felt miserable until he heard about this "cure-all" gene therapy. He was quoted as telling his friend, "What's the worst that could happen?" after he had decided to undergo gene therapy. Indeed, the worst did happen. He went through an extreme inflammatory reaction in response to the vectors he received, and developed jaundice and a blood-clotting disorder, eventually leading kidney, lungs, and brain lose function. (2) All in all, gene therapy is not the completely safe and effective "cure -all" procedure that it is twisted to be.
