TITLE: Minimum Wage

CATEGORY: Politics

I am debating that minimum wage is good and that we should not raise the wages.
 In my opinion we should not raise the wages we get paid.
 
 We don"t work at jobs just to work at jobs. The owners hire employees so that the employers/owners can make money. Let"s look at Burger King for instance. Let"s say they raise the wage to $20.00 an hour. If they don"t jack up their prices on their food they will lose money. Also raising the wage will not make anything better. Everything will just double the price. There will always be poor people, so that problem is not solved. Also money doesn't grow on trees.
 
 Let"s look at the sales example, say the wages are raise, which means the people who make car parts have to jack their prices up. Then when you go buy the truck or whatever car the price will be doubled. Taxes will be doubled too. So this is not a win win situation. Nothing will change, the only thing that will change is how much you get paid, but you will still be left over with less money than you started with.
