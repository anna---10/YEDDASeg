TITLE: Should the United States try to establish a stable democracy in Iraq?

CATEGORY: Politics

I would submit that the central thesis of your argument is inaccurate. There is little evidence that we're trying to establish a democratic government in Iraq. These claims by government officials are markedly out of step with our actions on the ground in Iraq, as well as our overall policy toward Iraq (especially when one considers the historical context for our involvement). There are a variety of factors that discount the contention that we're trying to implement democracy in Iraq:
 
 - The US government has closed down the free press in Iraq, shutting down media outlets that don't toe the official US line, going so far as to set up its own disinformation media and literally buying off staff for the other newsmedia in Iraq to "place" stories favorable to occupation.
 
 - The US government has disarmed the Iraqi population in spite of fact that a well-armed citizenry is supposedly integral to a democratic state. A segment of second amendment proponents have lamented the silence of groups like the National Rifle Association on this.
 
 - In spite of rampant violence, the US pressed forward with fundamentally undemocratic elections in Iraq. In the first round, conditions were such that voters did not know which candidates were on the ballot (making it impossible for them to vote in an informed manner) to protect the safety and security of the candidates themselves who were at high risk of being assassinated (and indeed, many of them were assassinated after the election by insurgents and sectarian groups).
 
 - In spite of proclamations, the US government has planted and backed virtually all of candidates for Prime Minister (from Ahmed Chalabi to Iyad Allawi). This is part of a long-standing policy of the US to interfere with the government of Iraq, going back to its backing of Saddam Hussein in the 1970s up through the end of the 1980s.
 
 - The US government has shown little regard for the rule of law in Iraq, a principle central to a democratic state. It has repeatedly ignored enforcing the law when it is inconvenient for the US (such as in applying it to civilian contractors) but also in applying it to the operations of the US government in Iraq. Even now, the US government refuses to abide by decisions made by the Iraqi government which is supposedly supposed to govern itself.
 
 - Another aspect of is the dismal failure to rebuild the country's infrastructure. Rather than move in the most financially-sound, efficient and expedient manner to restore the existing utility infrastructure, we sought to replace it with US products. Ignoring that war profiteering, there has been zero oversight in how reconstruction monies are spent – the General Accountability Office has repeatedly blasted the Administration for how it has lost outright or misspent billions of dollars.
 
 - Most egregiously, the US government has funded sectarian militias in the hopes that one side will exterminate the other – thus reducing conflict and establishing a one-sided authoritarian regime.
 
 Ignoring this evidence, there's the practical fact that it would be a waste for the US to invest in an independent nation that controls huge oil reserves that could become a major competitor to US economic interests.
 
 I'd like to respond to your sub-points individually, but unfortunately I'm limited by space – so perhaps I'll do that in the second round.
