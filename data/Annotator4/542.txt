TITLE: Affirmative Action

CATEGORY: Society

Yes, everyone is entitled to life, but they are required to maintain it, not us, it's like saying everyone is entitled to property, but because they can't take care of their stuff we should have to pay for them to get new stuff. The right to life, liberty, and property establishes that these rights shall not be infringed, not that we have to give it to them, if someone locks them self in their house, thus they do not have liberty at that moment, up to them to get out, not us, we are only required not to lock them in our house.
