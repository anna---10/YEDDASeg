TITLE: Could Canada and it's allies beat America and it's allies in a war.

CATEGORY: Politics

Britain     
  We made our independence from them, so we are essentially a branch of Britain. Furthermore, as I have already shown, the United State's biggest ally is Britain, [1] and vice versa. [2] The two countries share a special relationship. [3] The bond in correlation to Canada, however, is less strong. This shows that if anything, the United Kingdom would join forces with the United States rather than Canada. Moreover, government officials view the Great Britain as the United States' closest ally. [4]  
 
   Multiculturalism
 
  While my opponent claims the United States isn't as "multi-cultural" as Canada, this is false. The United States is in a majority multi-cultural and moving in the right direction. [5] This shows that the United States is in fact multi-cultural and is acceptant of different races. I don't necessarily see how this pertains to the debate, but I will argue it regardless. 
 
   Government
 
  My opponent says that Europe isn't a democracy and is socialist. While arguably true, Europe is not directly pertinent to this debate. Rather, the United States is. It is also a democracy that provides a multiplicity of freedoms and the citizens enjoy the benefits my opponent mentions: social security, health care, welfare, and unions. By this token, the US has everything that Canada does and more to please and keep contented citizens. The claim that the removal of socialism would cause riots and rebellions is inherently flawed and unfounded. Instead, the citizens would likely enjoy having more freedoms and be more contented with their state of being. Moreover, the United States is still a top-3 favorite place to live, as quoted by foreigners. [6] 
 
   Snipers
 
  My opponent brings up one example of a great Canadian sniper. However, this skill will not benefit their cause as he died in 1952. [7] Furthermore, a majority of the famous snipers belong to the United States. [8] Many of these Americans are still alive and could assist the US in the disputed conflict. Moreover, the United States has steadily been working to improve elite forces such as snipers to keep their military force strong and unpredictable. [9] The card of evidence my opponent brought up related only to Canadian warriors that were good in their time, yet none of them could be of any help during this conflict, as each one is now deceased. 
 
   Proving Through History
 
  My opponent claims that Canada has proved itself in the past with military endeavors and victories. While possibly true, the United States has done this and more. It has proved itself to be a world superpower. [10] It has also shown its superiority throughout the ages since it became such. [11] Besides being a military superpower, the US is also an economic superpower. [12] This would also be helpful in the chance of a long war. Furthermore, the US has been involved in some of the most defining wars in history. [13] In fact, the US was a major reason of victory in WW1. [14] The same is true for other wars, such as WW2. [15] This overwheliming assistance has proved the United States more than any other country, and has established itself as a global power. 
 
   Conclusion
 
  My opponent claims that Canada would not be alone, and that Zimbabwe could randomly join Canada's side. This rebuttal is very weak. Consequently, this assistance would be of little help to Canada. Compared to the United States military, Zimbabwe looks almost meaningless. [16] On the same token, Zimbabwe has the same chance to join the United States, which is actually more likely. An obscure country such as Zimbabwe would be much more likely to join the side with a more promising chance to win. In this scenario, as I have proved, it would be the United States. 
 
  In regards to bravery and intelligence, it is true that it can overcome numbers. But with such a great disparity as recognized in previous rounds, the chance is very slim. Furthermore, bravery and intelligence also belong to the United States, because of programs such as the FBI. [17] Besides the FBI, the US has the CIA, Navy SEALS and other programs, many of which are listed in this source. [18] 
 
  I believe I have already effectively shown that Canadians would likely not fight back if the US were to take over. 
 
  With this, I have effectively and comprehensively refuted all of my opponent's points. Even still, I have points standing with either little to none resistance, or concession. They are as follows: 
  1. Canada must face the US alone. 
  2. US is a superpower (conceded). 
  3. Military presence belongs to the US.
