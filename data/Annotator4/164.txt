TITLE: Reverse Euthanasia

CATEGORY: Society

Thanks to my opponent for his well thought-out response. It is true. Our intellects are brighter than yours, our wills stronger, and our kingdoms greater. There is no power stronger than ours.
 My opponent has offered a plan for which he must take all of your children. Through dangers untold and hardships unnumbered, he would fight his way there to your homes in your cities and take your children as if you had stolen them from him. He would do so with an army of goblin-like soldiers, and he would probably do so while wearing a large, threatening codpiece and sporting a flamboyant mullet... and nobody likes mullets.  No , liking mullets ironically doesn’t count.
 
  Definitions: 
 
 Garden of Eden: State of perfect human interaction with the Earth which creates the least amount of harm to all sentient beings and the most amount of happiness for the greatest number of sentient beings.
 
 Dystopia: State of humanity deemed necessary by my opponent wherein adults kill children in cold blood, execution style, etc etc. in addition to their continued dreadful extinction, imprisonment, and torture of various different species, encouragement of parasites and disease transmission, poverty, longest possible workdays, and whatever other horrible things you’re thinking right now or have ever thought of with the worst possible connotation via civilization’s existence.

  Part I: Dystopia 
 
 “All population replenishment is stopped, and all Human Liabilities are eliminated. This can be done via normal medical and legislative process, and does not require force of arms or any technology not currently in widespread use.”
 
 My opponent has stated here that getting rid of Human Liabilities will not require a force of arms. Though, it is clear that killing Fuzzy Ape spawn does require a force of arms. I’m not sure what to make of this contradiction so I will simply say this: kerfluffle. My opponents plan would lead to a dystopian future of parents going underground to escape the hordes of children-killing contractors sent in by the government for the “greater good.” I think there is a sci-fi movie about that already. It’s called “Bladerunner”...... but with hollow-eyed children instead of distraught androids which are the targets of the drugged and and misguided Bladerunners. 
 
 In the following paragraphs, my opponent states the benefits to civilization which would ensue given the early deaths of children. But the main problem with this can be summed up in the following simple equations: 
 
 benefits to civilization=detriments to the world
 
 surplus of food for the third world=more sex and more children and (so, according to his plan) more murder. To think that sex and childbirth will happen at a slower rate than that of ending Human Liabilities is yet another glaring example of the way my opponent views the world: through rose-colored glasses.
 
 Prosperity of society=damage to overall happiness as it encourages the opposite of the items listed at the end of my last round
 
 My opponent has also stated that “Peace would reign supreme” in his plan. This is more evidence of my opponents naive optimism, for animals war all the time. You cannot escape it. But when civilization is ended, there will be the least of it. You cannot end all war, you can simply get rid of what causes it the most. In the case of the Fuzzy Apes, it is the selfish, controlling harboring of resources as well as the insane, phobic urge to live sedentary lifestyles.
 
 Dystopia is a band-aid. It is not a final solution. This would lead to a great degree of pain and anguish in the short term and no greater happiness in the long-term. It would simply be a case of the Fuzzy Apes adding another species to the list of species they have caused to be extinct. In this case, it would be themselves. But another species need not die at the hands of these selfish creatures!!

  Part II: The Garden of Eden 
 
 My plan would lead to the Garden of Eden in time, where humans live in groups they are most biologically suited to live in- egalitarian, traveling bands- living stress-free, disease-free, poverty-free, war-free, burden-free, other-negative-things-free lives.
 
 My opponent states that “99.999% of humanity will die” to reach the Garden of Eden. This is not quite true. A great number will be lost, of course, but not quite that much. Anyway, a great number of humanity being killed off is precisely what is needed no matter what. My opponent acknowledges this fact. However, in his plan, 100% of humanity will eventually die. You see, that small percentage of humanity left standing in my plan will be sentient beings who can be happy thus, the greatest amount of happiness for the  greatest number . The Garden of Eden will last much longer than the short, alleged “Golden Age” my opponent is proposing. What he means to say is “Dystopia” but I don’t mean to get wrapped up in semantics here. You, gracious voters, know precisely what he means.
 
 Allegedly, my opponent does not believe in magic. It is true. He has never known a young girls heart, where the music can free her whenever it starts. He doesn’t respect magic because what he aims to do, dear readers, is end the very beating of young girls hearts-and young boys for that matter. It’s not that he doesn’t believe in magic, it’s that he wishes it were gone from this Earth. I would assert that he should believe in the magic contained in rock n roll, but it would be futile to attempt to explain it as everyone knows you can’t explain rock n roll to a stranger. Though I assure you, it’ll free your soul. Believe in the magic of a young girls soul. Believe in the magic of rock n roll. I’m talking about magic. 
 
 In addition, my opponent seems to forget another important source of the power of magic and voodoo- the babe. The many babes he will have ripped from their consciousness contain the dance magic he so abhors. They have the power. No amount of reasoning will change his jealousy of babes and young children for their magic is strong. He also uses a lot of ad hominems, but his blindly optimistic view toward this is unsettling.
 
 Now that I have clearly established the premise that magic exists, I will let you know that no, no horrifying dictatorship will be necessary to will Apple Regurgitation into reality. Magic is all that is necessary. Magic cannot exist in his plan, however, because my opponent is an evil sorcerer who wishes to rid the world of it's innocent sources of magic in an attempt to maintain control himself, preferably from the center of some kind of intractible network of stone walls which he uses to confusingly lure his young prey.
 
 Lastly, is starvation really that bad? I don’t think so. In light of the disease, parasites, extinction, wars, homicide, and systematic extinction of the human race, starvation for a small period, for only one part of one species, leading up to the Garden of Eden for all of eternity, is clearly the superior choice. Sacrifices must be made no matter what. That is what my kind-hearted opponent seems to deny.
 
 Anyone who votes for my opponent is a bleeding-heart liberal with no sense of justice, morality, or rationality. That or one of his goblin-like sidekicks.
