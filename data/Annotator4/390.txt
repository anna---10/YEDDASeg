TITLE: Containment

CATEGORY: Politics

Thanks for introducing this topic!!!
 
 The premise of my argument will be my concept of an active cosmopolitanism defined as actively pursuing the protection of all humans.
 
 Sovereign countries are only sovereign when they recognize the fundamental human rights of its citizens.  Unfortunately, a trademark of many countries is that they do not protect human rights or they perpetrate their abuse.  Thus, the US is obligated to contain governments that choose to violate human rights.
 
 There are two arguments supporting that.
 
 First, Dasching and Deschant in 2001 argue that neglecting the protection of human rights otherizes and dehumanizes victims, thereby reducing them to a bare life, devoid of value.  That is explicitly in violation of the etymological principle of 'human' rights.
 
 Additionally, Harries of Harvard University concurs with the argument that when the United States does not protect human rights on the international sphere, its credibility as a nation is reduced to a minimum.  As a result of our neglect, we are pressured to change policy by other countries in the United Nations and in the world.  The impact on our nation is a devolution of international power and acceptance, which opens the United States up to acts of violence and aggression by other countries.
 
 I have more arguments that will be introduced in the second constructive.
 I am excited to debate!!
