TITLE: THW implement mandatory military service

CATEGORY: Society

In a world where "freedom of choice" is a right people abuse wrongly, today on proposition, we believe that mandatory military service should be an exception to this abused right.
 Today I will begin the debate with two arguments:
 1 How it will promote Equality
 2 How they can protect others, and those before them.
 But to begin, I will present my Model:
 You must join between the age of 18 and 35, and you can have a week off for weddings, funerals, etc. Your time in the military will end after 3 years.
 
 I present my first argument, how it will promote equality.
 If the motion were passed, no matter who you are, a tramp on the streets, a celebrity in a mansion, you are still required to join the military. Under the threat of death in war, rich people will have to work together with these poorer people, and they will understand each other. The celebrity will finally have an honest day's work, and the poorer person will help close the discriminatory gap by helping out the richer.
 
 Moving on, onto my next and final argument, about how it means that you are protecting those before and after you. When you enter the military, you are protecting the society, just like the elderly will have joined the military to protect you! By joining the military, you are protecting the next generation, who will grow up to protect you, and you are protecting the elderly, who have protected you before!
 
 To implement mandatory military service to promote equality and protection, I am proud to propose
