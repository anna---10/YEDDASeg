TITLE: Cohabitation is a good idea

CATEGORY: Society

Ok I agree that they can know each other characters better but why after cohabitation when they married they divorce where is the evidence that cohabitation helped them. Over 30% of partners which married after cohabitation are divorced, according to sociologist Andrew Cherlin of Johns Hopkins University.I think most partners are didn"t show their true face before because if they do so may be their partner stops communicating with them and only after marriage they start to show their true face.
