TITLE: Gun Rights: Should we have guns?

CATEGORY: Politics

No matter how you slice it or dice it:
 
 Criminals will always have guns.
 
 Civillians will not have guns to protect themselves, and the few civillians that do protect themselves will be killed or abused because you said "the majority dosen't: so who cares?"
 
  http://www.theacru.org...  This is a Harvard study that shows the correlation between gun ownership and gun deaths is completely irrelivant. The study also shows how, in places with high gun control, the overall murder rate is MUCH, much higher.
 
 Scottsdale, Arizona is ranked one of the top cities with the lowest crime rate, and get this: It has almost NO gun control.
 "Scottsdale, AZ tops our list mainly due to the low number of violent crimes."-  http://www.areavibes.com...   http://en.wikipedia.org... 
 
 Plano, TX is also a top ranking in the top 10 cities with lowest crime rate. And: It has little to no gun laws! Suprise, suprise!
 
 Third on the list is Virginia. You will see that here, as crime rate goes up, so do gun laws, little by little.
 
 So, really, as long as we exist, guns will too. And we will never be rid of them. But these statistics show that towns with no gun laws are generally safer than ones with gun laws.
