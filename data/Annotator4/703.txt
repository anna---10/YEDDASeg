TITLE: the only perfect political system is anarchy

CATEGORY: Politics

Anarchy is the most perfect form of social governance that could ever be implemented. 'every man for himself', 'land and history unto the victor'. Anarchy is the natural order of society as every other form of governance places the lives of its people in the hands of an elect or inherent representative(s). Obviously any form of governance affects hundreds of factors in an individual's life and the society's structure so to keep the debate as concise and comprehensive as possible the different sectors of humanitarian structure shall be categorised as - infrastructure -ex- shelter and transportation , sustenance -ex- food and water, entertainment -ex- art and religion, environment -ex- pollution and biodiversity, development -ex- education.
