TITLE: Aliens are humans from the future

CATEGORY: Science

First of all I didn't say that when humans became smarter they grew bigger eyes and heads, I said over time we evolve.

 If you take a look at the link I gave you, you would see why we would change over all these years. And many people have said that aliens appear in some paintings from the past which may prove that they want to learn about their ancestors as you said. And it's possible that aliens could've left the earth because of things like radiation or global warming. Because of global warming the Earth is getting hotter, and soon it may be too hot for humans to live in. If the Earth is too hot to live in than humans may be forced to leave to a planet where they might be able to live in. So humans start to adapt and change the way they look and that concludes my debate.
