TITLE: Bristol Palin is a tax evader

CATEGORY: Politics

Bristol Palin, the daughter of the former Republican Governor, Sarah Palin, has been evading tax on the income she receives working the streets of Wasilla, Alaska.
 
 She did not declare how many tricks she turned last year or how much she charged each punter and she certainly has not paid any income tax on the money she earned from prostitution.
 
 It is therefore safe to conclude that Bristol Palin is a tax evader.
 
 Thank you.
