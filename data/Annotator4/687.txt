TITLE: Geocentrism

CATEGORY: Science

My opponent made two claims.  The first is that the spin of Earth makes hurricanes spin, but he provides no proof.  
 
 The second is that we can watch Earth spin from probes, but he provides no proof for this either.  It's not the Earth that we see spinning in space videos.  It's the satellite-mounted camera that is spinning around the Earth that makes it seem like the Earth is spinning in the video.
