TITLE: If Hillary wins the election it will be because she is a woman.

CATEGORY: Politics

I made this four rounds so both sides have a chance to give a very brief intro to what they're going to be saying during the debate.
 
 My side.
 
 I'm going to be showing how if Hillary wins, it would be because she's a woman. It is sad that American woman are doing this. I understand feminism, but I only beleive people should stand up for their rights if their rights are being violated. I know there are some cases where women make less money, but Hillary can't fix that. She is using the feminism part of woman brains to get them to vote for her.
