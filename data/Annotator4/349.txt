TITLE: Cloning should be legal and is morally acceptable.

CATEGORY: Science

These clones could be used to help with scientific research on the human body. They would not have feelings or emotions, therefore we could use them on an experimental basis. They could also be used for medical procedures. For example, if you needed a blood transfusion, we could clone you and get an exact match for your blood.
