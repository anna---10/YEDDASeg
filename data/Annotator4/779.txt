TITLE: Cops should not be allowed to tasered you if you refuse to get out of a vehicle

CATEGORY: Politics

A cop's judgement in an immediate situation is an appropriate trial. In a situation like the refusal to exit the vehicle, there is no time to get a trial on the spot. lifting by itself is a punishment, so this argument doesn't make sense. this argument about a civil society makes no sense. We use pain as a punishment all the time, and pain is not a bad thing all the time. How did we learn not to touch a hot stove? or not to touch a cactus? pain. pain is a necessary part of life to our survival and society. you make a timeframe argument that we should punish them later, but this is irrelevant because you're suggesting that we lift them out, which is a punishment by itself, yet not an effective one. what's the use of an ineffective punishment? we need to prevent future defiance by showing authority over the people, so it's really not a separate issue. thanks
