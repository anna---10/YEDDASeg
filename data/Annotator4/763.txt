TITLE: A hybrid of capitalism and socialism is the best economic solution

CATEGORY: Economics

Going straight into the argument...   
  
  I think that what your write is practically impossible. Every economy where capitalism is practiced becomes monopolised by capitalism. Look at China's socialist market economy-- practically it is capitalist. Cuba, Vietnam where we see an extreme form of capitalism where the few have the majority of wealth. It is true that all these regimes have a bourgeois class but because profit is the key prerogative of any commercial enterprise, all socialist principles must over time give way and corrode to this model of profit.  
  
  It might be that this hybrid you write of might be the most desirable solution (that I am unsure of and would hope you can persuade me of). To say it is the most effective solution however, simply ignores the demonstrable practical consequences of both socialism and capitalism being enacted in a country.
