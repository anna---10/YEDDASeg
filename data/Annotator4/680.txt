TITLE: A license should be required to parent

CATEGORY: Society

Parents carry a huge responsibility of a child"s life. Many parents today are abusers and criminals. Almost every ten seconds a child abuse report is made, and particularly in the U.S around four to seven children die because of child abuse and neglect ( https://www.childhelp.org...  ). Many children are also too afraid to tell anyone about the abuse they get, and therefore get physically hurt by their parents everyday. This doesn"t only physically damage their health, but also mentally. Countless of kids get depression, and start to self harm themselves. In 2015, in U.S it was estimated that 3 million children aging from 12 to 17 had at least one depressive time in the past year ( https://www.nimh.nih.gov... ). As well as depression, children can get anxiety and can even commit suicide. Children need good parents protection, and in order for that, there has to be laws and license done to getting a child. Society should protect these precious, and innocent kids before they can be damaged ( http://www.pbs.org...  ).
