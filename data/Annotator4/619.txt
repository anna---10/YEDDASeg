TITLE: The obese should not get the same benefits as the disabled.

CATEGORY: Politics

[1] Your Resolution is not very clear. When you say "benefits", do you mean that the obese shouldn't get Government benefits, family benefits, insurance benefits, or social benefits? Your Resolution is not very clear to me. The obese doesn't get benefits at this moment, but they are no different from the disabled. At this moment, the obese are treated equally as any other person in the world.
 
 [2] The obese are hardworking. Many obese people still contribute greatly to the society, as well as the disabled. Many of the obese are disabled. Should they not get the same benefits as the non-obese and disabled? My answer is no. Everybody IS equal.
 
 [3] Since when did the obese get benefits? According to my research, the obese don't get benefits unless they are also disabled. Why is your resolution "THe obese shouldn't get same benefits", when there were no obese benefits in the first place? The obese are treated equal as anyone else.
