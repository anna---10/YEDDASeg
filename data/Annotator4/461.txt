TITLE: is current day democracy actually good for us?

CATEGORY: Politics

The modern day democratic system is in my view not very effective as I believe it is quite easy to fool people. The only criteria for winning an election is get as many people by your side as possible . What is the guarantee that those people actually believe in what they are saying. I don't mean to say that dictatorship is good but that the current day democratic system is defective..
