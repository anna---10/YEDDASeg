TITLE: Should parents let children under 13 have a Facebook account?

CATEGORY: Society

True its really not safe for anyone not even for adults because their are people out to get you and others. You have to be safe. Why would anyone want to have to be logged in and out of their own account? Would anybody or would you rather just not have a Facebook at all. Think on the big scale miss Jackson, what about all those kids out their under the age of thirteen whose parents haven't properly raised them? Are they to have a Facebook, and have to endure some of the most terrifying things in life that are their to offer to those who have little guidance in their life? please opponent enlighten me.
