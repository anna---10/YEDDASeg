TITLE: is homosexuality wrong from a non religious stand point?

CATEGORY: Science

Sirs, to begin and also relieve everyone of the need to guess,
 may I state I am not gay and would class myself as an anti-religious theist.
 
 No, because it clearly exists in the physical world.
 And if it exists it is perfect - how could it be anything else.
 In this way, all information is neutral.
 If you want to take a position to say whether it is wrong or right
 regardless of what standpoint you use , becomes a subjective issue
 which must then rely of imagination -the lowest form of knowledge.
 It is not truth. It is not to be relied upon. If it were we would all think the same
 about everything.
 
 But let us swing back to why you asked this question.
 I can appreciate your argument and the need to want to ask this question.
 It is interesting to me because I was trained in molecular microbiology.
 One special area of interest to me is evolution.
 You are saying "Yes because of evolution based on the fact that such couplings are fruitless
 and therefore not useful or not productive, as in machine efficiency?
 Therefore they are not intended by evolution, thus therefore wrong?
 Just so we can be clear, do tell and thanks for the debate.
