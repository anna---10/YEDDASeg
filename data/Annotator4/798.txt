TITLE: Resolved: The repeal of DADT was the favorable decision for the United States.

CATEGORY: Politics

the reason I only gave one reason is because there only is one reason I will not try to argue that being a homosexual makes you a bad soldier. The only reason there is is the issue of moral but moral is one of the biggest factors in warfare what happens when your soldiers don't want to fight you die so if we repeal dadt then we are paying for it in moral people wont die for a cause they oppose so we should just have gays keep their mouths shut then it keeps America safer. Also American idealism there is no such thing Americans conflict ideas everywhere there is no real American ideal so what are the soldiers supposed to fight for?
