TITLE: good effects of outsourcing

CATEGORY: Politics

outsourcing. i used to be against it, but i want to argue some reasons for it that i have been thinking of.
 
 if companies can save money, even though we lose some wealth ot foreign nations, the money saved ultimately is reinvested. that leads to innovation. that means that more things are made, different things. if more things are made, that means the cost of everything else is less. true, we have less money, but, if the government prints some money, while inflationary, it's only mitigating the decrease in the price of goods by the increased product. (if not too much is printed)
