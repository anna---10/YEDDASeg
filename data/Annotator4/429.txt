TITLE: The executive travel ban, should it stay or go?

CATEGORY: Politics

The terrorist attacks are not required to be in the U.S in order for it to be a concern. I call it "being proactive". Our screening process can't possibly tell the intent of the person coming into the U.S. They can simply lie.
 
 If we allow them to come to the U.S, they could do whatever they want. They don't even need to carry out the attacks, they can recruit more Radicals to fight us. When you see events such as the Boston bombing or all of the shootings such as the Orlando nightclub shooting ( http://www.cnn.com... ). This man pledges his allegiance to ISIS and shot up a gay nightclub. Attacks like these on U.S soil can not be tolerated.
 
 We don't know who is a radical and who is not. I know that my opponent will use that phrase against me in the next submitted argument, but the point still stands. The liberals have not provided a legitimate way to combat terrorism and have used the word racist so much that it has lost its value.
 
 The travel ban may not be the best way, but it is the only thing we have as of now. If anyone can present a better idea than it, I would listen.
