TITLE: The role of the U.S government in Developing Nations

CATEGORY: Politics

I will agree with my opponents statement that the current process of giving aid to forien developing nations is flawed but not in the way that he implys. I believe that when the US chooses to support a GOVERNMENT through aid that we have an obligation to see that that aid is used to fund things that are consistent with US goals. When the US provides HUMANITARIAN aid I believe that aid should go to the people the aid was intended for. If the money is being misused then the money should stop being sent. I think that anytime the US gives out money the US gov. has a responsibility to know that the money is going to the intended recipient and that the money is not being misused.
 
 Thanks for the debate.
