TITLE: Las Vegas is a better city then Chicago

CATEGORY: Society

Alright, I shall accept your debate. Let me start of by saying that Las Vegas there are also many crimes that happened on the past few years. Ever heard of Tupac Shakur, the most famous and talented rapper in the world, well he got shot in Vegas. You may read about it, on this site (  http://www.franksreelreviews.com... ). Another reason why Chicago has more crimes then Vegas is since Chicago is the 3rth most populated city in the whole US and Vegas is the ranked 30. Chicago has approximately 2,695,598 people , while Las Vegas has 583,756 ( http://www.nlc.org... ). Lets be honest, if Las Vegas had that many people, there might be allot of crime. There are also lots of casinos and bras there in Las Vegas, more then Chicago, so that may cause lots of people ending up drunk which will lead them to do some crazy things. Las Vegas might have a better weather then Chicago, but you just know that Chicago has a very powerful economy. Chicago is part and is the largest of the three Great Lake cities. The other two are Detroit and Toronto, from Canada. In fact, lots of people from other cities in the North America come to Chicago to get a better job. Chicago also always had a good history of trades  http://en.wikipedia.org... . If you are a fan of sports, you will like Chicago allot since in Chicago there are many teams in different sports such as the NBA Chicago Bulls, the NHL Chicago Blackhawks, the NFL Chicago Bears, the MLB Chicago White Sox and Cubs, and many more ( http://en.wikipedia.org... ). I cant really name any sport teams from Las Vegas. So that ends round one.
