TITLE: Cyber-bullying upon social media is very preventable

CATEGORY: Society

I would like to start off my argument first by saying, I do not understand how cyber bullying on the Internet is as bad as it is. I mean I believe it's very simple to prevent such things from happening, I'm my experience only add friends that you know and anyone who even slightly abuses you, just block them and if serious enough report them, there are buttons on websites such as facebook and twitter that do allow for this despite the news reports.
 
 Now please do not bring other examples of cyber bullying into this as I do realise that other examples of cyber bullying such as via mobile phone is harder to prevent. This argument is for social media only.
