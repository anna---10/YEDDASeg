TITLE: Do animals be amused and presented in a circus or used to be kept in their natural habitats

CATEGORY: Society

Animals should be kept in their natural habitats since that's where they are suppose to be and live naturally. They feel very intimidated and pushed by their trainors in a circus and they feel uncomfortable by their context perhaps they might be afraid of their predators and isolated in one area where they don't at least communicate with their type. Some animals need a wide amount of space to be able to hunt for food not to be fed by their trainors in a compact enclosure depends on how much the size is of the animal
 
 I think that it is horrible to keep wild animals such as tigers, lions and monkeys in captivity. They are not able to rome freely. It is hard because they are not able to communicate with us which is why people are able neglect animals. I also believe that is alright to have domestic animals in captivity (as long as the are treated okay) because they no longer fit the lifestyle of wild habitats
 
 The reason people want to ban animals in the circus is clearly because of the way they are treated not only cared for but how they are made to do tricks by being hit and abused otherwise its kind of obvious they wouldnt follow a human unless it seemed like they were in charge.
