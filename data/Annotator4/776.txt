TITLE: FDI is not India's expressway to economic slavery

CATEGORY: Economics

base job training such as customer service and manual labor are the
 
 only key area of expertise promoted by the FDI. India has become increasingly reliant on outsourced jobs as more
 
 and more companies put FDI into it. As India becomes more trained in these jobs, they are losing expertise in
 
 others. There are less entrepreneurs, less businessmen, etc. The country is losing so much potential that if the
 
 companies leave India, these people would be stuck with worthless skills. 500 limit??!
