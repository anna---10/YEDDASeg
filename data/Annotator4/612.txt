TITLE: Governments should deficit spend in a recesion

CATEGORY: Economics

According to the Keynesian theory, governments should balance the economy by overspending during recessions and saving during periods of growth. Unfortunately, Keynesian model totally ignores the political realities. While governments are happy to overspend during recessions, it is almost never in the interest of ruling politicians to cut spending back.
 
 Consequently, western countries that adopted Keynesian principles experienced almost uninterrupted growth of debt. At present, most governments (with the notable exceptions of Greece and Iceland) can still pay the interest by taking on new loans. However, the current system ensures that in the long-term the default is virtually unavoidable.
 
 Since, thanks to the Keynesian economics, the government is now a major part of the economy, its default is likely to result in worse crisis than the Great Depression.
