TITLE: The Elton John AIDS Foundation should be forced to close

CATEGORY: Society

EVEN IF IT WERE   
  Assuming the Elton John Foundation was discriminatory in its practices, it still positively affects the world than it would if it were forced to close. Under what my opponent asserts, the Elton John Foundation helps only gay HIV/AIDS victims. To understand why this isn't a problem, consider the following: 
 
  Let's put this down into simplified numbers. Let's say the Elton John Foundation can only help 10 people with AIDS. They will only help gay men. 
 
  Another foundation will help anyone, but they too can only service 10. 
 
  Then we've got 20 people seeking help. 10 are gay men, 10 are not. Thanks to the presence of the Elton John Foundation, there are more slots available for people in the other foundation who will help anyone.  
 
  Every AIDS assistance program that is closed directly results in less people having care. Charities and programs can only assist so many.  
 
 
    FACTS   
  My opponent has reasserted his claim of Elton John's foundation practicing discrimination. He has provided no evidence to support his claim. If you are not convinced by my above argument, then I encourage you to follow the link I posted in my previous round, and investigate the Elton John Foundation yourself.
