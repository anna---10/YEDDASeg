TITLE: There is/was intelligent life living in the universe besides humans

CATEGORY: Science

I understand that there is no evidence, but I'm going on beliefs and personal experiences. I know my argument title kind of asks for specific events and evidence, but I took my debate as arguing your beliefs. There has been one main evidence that there have been many arguments over, and it is one of the biggest alien conspiracies to date. That would be the Roswell incident. It just so happens that today is the 66th anniversary of the Roswell incident today. Many people argue over what was really found, a weather balloon, which the government says it was, or a flying saucer, like many eye witnesses say it was. I am going for the existence of aliens, now or at some point, during the worlds own existence. I know that there is not a lot of evidence, but I'm hoping that one day there will and the Roswell incident could hopefully prove for my case.
