TITLE: Is it possible to love more than one person at once?

CATEGORY: Society

1.In premise 1 disagree with the implementation of sexual attraction being absolutely necessary in love. It is not absolutely necessary in a romantically loving relationship under the circumstance of time. All human beings are subject to the consequence of old age in the passing of time, thus leading to unavoidable physical change at some point. And the idea of love goes back dating prior to medical enhancement surgery that is more readily accessible now, prior to 1850.
 
 2.In premise number 4, I beg to differ on attachment being expressed exclusively as a foundation for a romantic relationship. Because it is possible to have a strong life long attachment to a non-romantic partner. For example soldiers that are brothers of war and have survived near death experiences are attached/bonded in ways unknown to non-war brethren.
 
 3.In premise number 6, there is a variance in understanding of the definition of socially constructed concepts. Human Beings are distant relatives to primates who are part of the animal kingdom. There are known animals that live and congregate in a variety of different "social" ways.
 
 4.Premise number 8 is a subjective claim, because I have witnesses people in polygamous relationships that are acting out of selfishness and are using the other for equitable benefits and survival out of necessity.
 
 5. In premise number 9 it is open to interpretation that "one example" of love is needed to determine the validity of this claim because there are other factors such as mental health background information that would be unknown.
