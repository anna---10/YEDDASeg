TITLE: Donald Trump is not qualified for president of the United States

CATEGORY: Politics

Read your profile. "Quite frankly doing nothing at all". The reason I took longer than you to write something is because I work. Given what I've read in your profile, it's probably a fair bet you're going to grow up to be a leach on society and "doing nothing" will be considered your career.
 
 OK, fair. You won because in my haste to squeeze this debate into a working, meaningful life contributing to society I didn't get your round order nonsense right. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to get some sleep so I can wake up tomorrow morning and work so that I can generate tax dollars for the government to pay for lazy liberal leaches like yourself so you can sit on your rear end and never have to contribute to society.
