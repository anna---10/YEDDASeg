TITLE: suicide is morally permissible

CATEGORY: Society

Hello, so thanks for responding.
 Heres the answer to your questions.
 Suicide is the act of one harming oneself, even if the attemp is not fatal it is still suicide. Hence attemp suicide.
 2: There is no need for evidence. It is plainly obvious that it wont only effect the individual, but also friends and family but for arguement sake here is some anecdotes on the internet.
 "I lost an uncle to suicide when I was 10. There were signs with him. I'm still haunted by his death, and not one day goes by that I don't think of him and what might have been. I'm turning 32 at the end of the month."---- this is found on  http://forums.families.com...  and there are plenty more out there.
 I dont understand what you mean by "do you agree that a person's value to life is 0 when they are dead"
 Now Ill counter some of your statements.
 "The issue we are questioning here is whether it is right for an indivduals to commit suicide"------ I am saying that the indivdual does not have to right to take away his life as it will effect others.
 
 Also you say that "suicide makes their state better by dying, and setting their value to life to zero"---- So you are saying that suiciding makes the victim's state somehow better by dying and that when they are living their "value to life" is less then zero?
 Also you have not any evidence on proving there is really a case where "living is worse then death".
 Ill also like to point out the obvious fact that suicide is illgeal. To relate back to arguement the person who suicides does not have the right to do so as it is against the law in nearly every country.--- http://en.wikipedia.org...
