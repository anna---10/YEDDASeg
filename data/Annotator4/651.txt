TITLE: When Liberals say minorities they don't mean Asians

CATEGORY: Society

While I totally agree that racism against Asians is real, that has little to do with your topic. The topic is whether Asians are included in the narrative of equality. Not whether there is racism against them.
 
 There is racism in the college process for Asian Americans, it is harder for them to get into elite colleges--but that isn't the topic. I think when most liberals say minorities, they mean all people of color.
