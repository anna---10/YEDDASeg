TITLE: Resolved: All Middle Eastern nations should be reformed into one nation called 'Islamistan'

CATEGORY: Politics

"I do not think this was well thought through. Instead, the middle eastern countries should unite to become "Imabenchland," lead by almighty imabench." 
 
 ............................. Go on...................
 
  "But why would Imabenchland be better? Because with Imabench in power, there won't have to have invading, as imabench is pro-US" 
 
 ............................. Go on...................
 
  "Third, with imabench in power of Imabenchland, imabench would give the US the oil. " 
 
 AHAHAHAHHA, Are you out of your mind?!?!?!? If im sitting on just over 50% of the world's oil then im not simply going to turn all of that over to the US, Im going to turn that into the greatest money maker ever seen in history! Im going to need all that money too if im going to have enough cash to raise all the children that I conceive with my 300+ wives that I plan on wedding. Plus the boats, the planes, the tv's, etc all cost money which im only going to have to get through oil exports. 
 
 
 
 
 
  "Fifth With Imabenchland, not only are there less nuke threats, Imabench will give the US any nukes the middle easy might have." 
 
 Well I wouldnt GIVE all of them over to the US, id probably just sell them off to the highest bidder since im a firm believer in capitalism...... Im also a firm believer in fiscal responsibility so I would also only sell nukes to nations who dont have a crippling national debt, which I guess kinda negates the US out of any bidding. China is doing pretty well, maybe theyll be interested in a couple hundred nukes...... 
 
 
 
 
 
  "Seventh, Israel is a Jewish state, not Islamic. There are Muslims there, but mostly Jews" 
 
 If Jews become a problem we can just send them to Florida and New York, im pretty sure that the Jews own those states by now anyways. 
 
  "Eighth, Imabenchland would be awesome." 
 
 Well that cant be disputed so, I concede that argument. 
 
 
 
 ============================================================================================
 
 
 
 Even though I would love to be the undisputed dictator of the entire Middle East and own half of the world's oil, I would probably be a massive dick of a ruler, and by probably i mean its a certainty....... I can say for sure I wouldnt simply hand the keys of my empire over to the US and that if they want my oil they are going to have to pay for it just like everyone else does..... Maybe ill jack up oil prices to $10 a gallon just to make that much more money, im gonna need it if im going to build by Islamic Death Star by the year 2050.......
 
 Point is that it would be better for all these nations to be united into Islamistan rather than Imabenchland because Islamistan wouldnt jack oil prices up to $10 a gallon just for money, or forcefully move all the Jews in Israel back to Florida + New York, or sell a thousand nukes to China like I would in my kingdom of Imabenchland
