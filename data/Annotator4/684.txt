TITLE: In In Defense of Evil part 2 of 3: A Wide Scale Eugenics program would be beneficial to the U.S.A

CATEGORY: Society

Thank you con for accepting this debate.   What the eugenics program won't be.
 
 Part one
 
 Benefits of a higher IQ society,
 
 Lower crime rate-
 
 IQ has been shown to be highly correlated with a person's likelihood to commit crime[1][2]. Increasing the average IQ of the nation will substantially lower its crime rate. A reduced crime rate would mean a safer society for everyone.
 
 Less poverty,
 
 IQ has also been linked to the level of income and education a person receives[1][2]. Putting a significant dent in the poverty rate. Any eugenics program implemented would likely pay for it's self by reducing the level of welfare payments being paid out by the government as well. Likelihood of collecting welfare is also highly correlated with IQ levels as well [1][2].
 
 Increases the GDP of a nation,
 
 IQ is also highly correlated with the GDP of nations[3]. If the United States implemented a eugenics program we could increase the nations GDP.
 
 Increase the countries military strength,
 
 There is a strong connection between military strength and GDP. By increasing the GDP of a country you also increase it's military might. Top 10 countries by GDP[5] and military strength[6].
    0  highest GDP  military strength    1  United States  United States    2  China  Russia    3  India  China    4  Japan  India    5  Germany  United Kingdom    6  Russia  France    7  Brazil  Germany    8  United Kingdom  South Korea    9  France  Italy    10  Italy  Brazil  
 
 As you can see a eugenics program that increases IQ level will also increase military strength.
 
 A big reduction in genetic disorders,
 
 Imagine a world with significantly less genetic disorders. A good eugenics program can provide that. Here is a list of genetic disorders that may be preventable[7].
 
 1. Cystic fibrosis
 2. Down syndrome
 3. Fragile x syndrome ( commonly associated with developmental delays and retardation)
 4. Inherited blood clotting problems
 5. Huntington's disease
 6. Muscular dystrophy
 7. Sickle cell anemia
 8. Tay Sach's disease.
 9. Alzheimer's
 
 And many, many more.
 
 Part 2
 
 How to implement the eugenics program,
 
 The propaganda campaign,
 
 The war on drugs is a complete failure[8]. The money used on the "war on drugs" propaganda campaign can be directed to fund a propaganda campaign to encourage in vitro fertilization for couples trying to have children.
 
 Subsidizing the eugenics program,
 
 The reduced number of people on welfare and the reduced number of diseases that are extremely expensive to take care of should more then make up for the heavy amount of subsidization necessary to fund the eugenics program. This is a program that pays for it's self.
 
 The process,
 
 Once women go in to take part in, in vitro fertilization they will given a choice of healthy embryos with factors such as disease and intelligence taken into account while evaluating them. This process is known as preimplantation genetic diagnosis (or PDG for short)[9].
 
 In vitro fertilization and extensive PDG won't be the only part of the eugenics program. Prenatal diagnosis and testing for genetic disorders combined with gene therapy would help avoid several genetic disorders as well as altering or removing genes associated with low IQ.
 
 Research for gene therapy needs to also be ramped up by using federal funding to provide research grants. A lot of this stuff is already being done on a small level. What I'm talking about here is just ramping up efforts to make a smarter, healthier and safer society.
 
 I anxiously await my opponents arguments.
