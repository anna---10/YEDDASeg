TITLE: The earth is flat.

CATEGORY: Society

Okay,
 So I'm not really sure what you are wanting to debate. In the second paragraph, you were talking about the moon landing. But in the third paragraph you were talking about flat earth.
 
 You wrote the motion of this debate, "The earth is flat," so I'm just gonna respond to that part of it. So, you brought up this one flight that went from Bali to Los Angeles, but I just looked up, "flights from Bali to Los Angeles," and there were more than 5 flights going there alone.
 
 Flights: Bali--> LA:
 1. China Southern
 2. China Airlines
 3. EVA Air
 4. Cathay Pacific
 5. Hong Kong Airlines
 
 All of these flights go from Bali to Los Angeles without making a stop. So yes, that one time when they stopped in Alaska is weird, but it's and outlier. That doesn't happen that much, or at all, so I don't think that the theory of, "the government is hiding something," is true.
 
 Not every flight going from Bali to Los Angeles results in a woman's water breaking, and a stop. So I don't think that you evidence is very strong.
 
 Good Job
 
 Thanks
