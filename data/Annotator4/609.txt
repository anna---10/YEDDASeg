TITLE: Scientist have the moral duty to point how stupid are pseudosciences.

CATEGORY: Science


   It is easy to find pseudosciences trying to prove the extraterrestrials already invade us, or that the bible is 100% accurate, or that alternative medicine works, etc.   
   Scientist are paid by the state and they should return the favor by helping layman to understand what science really is, and by mocking non scientific beliefs.
