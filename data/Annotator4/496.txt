TITLE: Sexual attraction for My Little Pony indicates Pedophilia?

CATEGORY: Society

I would like to thank my opponent for accepting this debate.  Since pedophilia is defined as the sexual attraction towards prepubescent children, that means if we can show that the sexual urges are geared towards post-pubescent adults within the show, the link is severed between sexual attraction to the main characters and pedophilia.     Let us begin by examining our “mane” characters (pun created by the show… because they are ponies).  At no point is anyone’s age firmly stated or established, so we have to go by indicators within the show.  One of the first things we can look at for a glimpse of their “age” is their maturity level.  Now, people will quickly point out that one’s age does not define their maturity; however, there is a correlation between the two.  All members of the Mane 6 live on their own (or as in Applejack’s case and arguably Twilight’s, as head of the household) and hold down steady jobs [1][2][3][4][5][6].  It is seen numerous times through the show that they exchange coins, or bits, as currency for services, indicating that there is a working economy and that they must manage their income and expenses.  We can be sure that these are not just cases of runaways, as Twilight, Pinkie Pie, and Rarity have all introduced their parents, showing that they merely grew up and moved out on their own (Applejack’s parents passed away and she now runs the farm, oh, spoiler, sorry).     Let us also consider the alternative universe of Equestria Girls [7].  In this world, Twilight and her counter parts are all high school girls.  It is stated by Fluttershy that “Sunset Shimmer is gonna rule the school until we graduate [8]” showing that they are in the same grade as Sunset Shimmer.  Prior to that we see a scene where Sunset Shimmer has been crowned the Princess of the Fall Formal three times previously at this High School [9].  This shows that all of the Mane 6 are, at least in this universe, High School Seniors.     Lastly, we see in Season 1, Episode 12, “Call of the Cutie” that the formation of Cutie Marks is a flagrant symbol for puberty [10].  This also coincides with MLP:EG in which the Cutie Mark Crusaders are in HS, likely as freshmen (they are considered late bloomers for getting their cutie marks, indicating that they are hitting puberty late, which 9 th  grade is “late” but not unreasonably).  All the Mane 6 have had their Cutie Marks for an extended period of time.     I will end on this and allow my opponent to showcase their arguments for why being sexually attracted to My Little Pony suggests that one is a pedophile.     I realize that in many of the “odd topic” debates that have been done for things like rape and bestiality, people have stated up and down things like “I have not supporting rape, only arguing this side for the sake of debating.”     So, allow me to make my statement.  This is a debate regarding sexual urges towards MLP and as to if it speaks at all to me or my feelings…
