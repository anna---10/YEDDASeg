TITLE: The Federal Minimum wage should NOT be raised

CATEGORY: Economics

Sometimes the utility of a debate is that it helps to refine one's statement. When I say "The Federal Minimum wage should NOT be raised", I mean it should not be raised NOW. The debate question had its genesis in news articles from New York and elsewhere as a response to people protesting for an increase. Raising the wage now is the wrong response , to the wrong problem and at the wrong time.
 
 With the current level of unemployment, and those who are not in the labor market, the minimum should not be raised until those issues are resolved. To raise it NOW only compounds the overall problem with the economy.
 
 When the federal government begins to act responsibly, this issue could be revisited.
 
 California may be raising their in-state minimum to $10 per hour. Let's wait and see what their experience shows.
 
 In the meantime, I still stand that "The Federal Minimum wage should NOT be raised at this time."
