TITLE: Government Surveillance

CATEGORY: Politics

Should government be allowed to watch our every move, monitor our telecommunications, emails and Internet usage? having an ultimate, all knowing, superior government makes me extremely uneasy. The biggest threat to a democracy is the government itself. So if nothing can stop it, then we are no longer living in a democracy, merely a soft tyranny.
