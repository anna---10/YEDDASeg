TITLE: 200th Debate: Drunk Driving Should Be Legal

CATEGORY: Politics

Acceptance: I accept Wylteds Debate, and will be arguing the Drunk Driving should not be made Legal. 
 
 
  I will be using a website to hold my sources:   http://tny.cz... 
  The reason being that I tend to use multiple sources, and will sometimes turn a 9,000 character argument into 12,000 characters. So bear that in mind. They will of course still be categorized so as to be easily found.
