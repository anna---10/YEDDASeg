Everything is Everything. If you understand the definitino of everything that I provided you would understand that everything cannot be just something. Everthing it all things. Something is some things. Everthing cannot be the same as something because there are 3 things that a thing can be. Everything = all things. Something = some things. Nothing = no things. It doesn't make sense to swap round definitions and words because that makes things complicated and it doesn't make any sense.
 
   Thoughts are very complicated and are still not fully understood to this day but that doesn't mean that they don't make sense. It means that at the moment we do not have the technology and equipment to fully understand thoughts and the human brain. We may never completely understand the human brain primarily due to its infinitely complex structure. 
 
   Information isn't mental in most people's opinion. Whilst information is not always factual for example if I said that my sister has blonde hair, this is a piece of information. You don't know for a fact what my sister's hair colour is so you will have to assume that her hair colour is blonde because you have no reason to think otherwise. Information can also be factual for example I could say that grass is green. To me this is a fact because when I look at grass I see the colour green.
 
   Yes, the brain is physical - I never said it wasn't. I said that thoughts and information are not physical things. Did you just say that the brain is not part of the brain? I don't think I have to respond to that in any great detail for everyone to see the great flaw in that argument.
