TITLE: Guns Should be Banned for Civilians in the USA

CATEGORY: Politics

I am a liberal who supports gun control, but I do not think that it would be best to ban guns from civilians. Banning guns from civilians goes too far in my opinion, and I shall introduce arguments about why this would be a bad idea. 
 
 First I will respond to Pro's claims
  "Statistics show that in countries where guns have been banned completely there is a severe drop in the amount of crime in the area" 
 
 List of countries that have completely banned civilians from owning guns
 1) China (And we know how tyrannical they are)
 2) East Timor (Currently crawling with militias, so their ban is very very ineffective)
 3) Romania 
 4) Israel (And we all know how unstable that region is :P)
 5) Japan (Ok they're pretty stable)

 So banning guns doesnt necessarily lead to peace and stability
 
  "It is a whole lot easier for a person to shoot someone than it is to stab them, not just physically but emotionally" 
 
 It makes it harder but it certainly doesnt make it impossible though.... in 2010 there were over 8,500 deaths caused by guns but there were also 1,700 deaths caused by knives.

  "There is far too much access to guns in the USA which is why people don't feel safe unless they have their own gun" 
 
 But US citizens have the right to self defense, and if they feel that a handgun is the best way to defend themselves then a gun ban will only be doing more harm then good. Self defense doesnt just include defense against other people with guns, it includes defense against burglars, muggers, animals, gangs, thiefs, sexual assault, rape, etc. which means banning all guns would make people more vulnerable to attack before any good came out of it. 
 
 ================================================================
 
 Arguments against banning all guns for civilians in the US:
 
 1) People own guns for reasons other then self protection, including simply firing at targets or for hunting.

 2) Using guns as protection is effective. 
 
 "A 1982 survey of male felons in 11 state prisons dispersed across the U.S. found:
 • 34% had been "scared off, shot at, wounded, or captured by an armed victim"
 • 40% had decided not to commit a crime because they "knew or believed that the victim was carrying a gun"
 • 69% personally knew other criminals who had been "scared off, shot at, wounded, or captured by an armed victim"

 So using guns for self defense is extremely effective. 
 
 3) Banning handguns has proven to nto be effective here in the US. 
 
 Washington DC and Chicago have tried handgun bans only to see the number of homicides increase in specific periods after the ban was implemented

 ^ The same source shows that right to carry firearm laws have led to less murders then when you couldnt carry in the states of Florida, Michigan, and Texas, states that have had notoriously high crime rates in the past. 
 
 4) Its a constitutional Right to bear arms 
 
 Second Amendment
 
 5) If guns were to be banned from civilians, how the hell would the government collect all the guns?
 
 There are about a hundred million of firearms in the US that are divided among hundreds of thousands of US households, and if guns were to be banned from civilians the government would have to come up with some way to check all the houses for all the guns and somehow legally confiscate them (aka get around the second amendment). if the government were to go door to door to search for firearms, it would cost taxpayers a sh*tload of money and im sure that such an effort would be horrendously ineffective anyways. Guns shouldnt be banned from civilians because the task of going and getting these guns would be monumental and doomed to fail. 
 
 6) Conceal-Carry laws would be more effective in fighting crime then banning all guns. 
 
 I mentioned this before under argument 3 where it has been shown that conceal-carry laws decrease crime better then banning handgun ownership. 
 
 ==========================================================================
 
 Now look I am all for increased background checks and not letting felons or the mentally ill own a firearm, along with having people register to own a firearm..... But even I think that banning all civilians from owning a gun is just not an effective way to fight crime, and its also a massive breach in constitutional rights....
