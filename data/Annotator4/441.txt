TITLE: Puerto Rico should become a state

CATEGORY: Politics

" It has been shown time and time again that allow a territory in as a state causes a period of marked economic growth."
 
   Yes because the areas we adopt have a lot of natural reasources. PR would be the least wealthy (sounds nicer) state which would drain our social programs, and raise debt. Places we have adopted example Utah have abundant reasources and other benifits, PR is a bad state as it's economy struggles. 
 
   " The United States of America does NOT have an official language"
 
  I was hoping you would say this:
 
  In a new twist to the contentious immigration debate, the Senate has voted to designate English the national language of the United States, and to effectively ban federal government ordinances and services in any language other than English. [1]
 
 So yeah recently this happened. 
 
 Also language can be a reason to keep them out, if lets say the congo (if their crime and economy improve) become a common wealth and then try to be a state, then we could say "how would you function? You don't speak english." It is a good reason. 
 
    "That is a terrible argument"  
 
 Not to be rude, but your arguments aren't better. Also it is a good argument as PR would totally effect this country, and out do our other 50 states. It would give republicans free wins (by small margins) which is good lol but isn't good as I think that if it cancels out the other 50 states, then it isn't worth it. 
 
    "Opinions change over time."  
 
 Yes so do cars but is it not fair to say a Jaguar Xk2 is better than a toyota prius and will be for a long time. Also so what? At the time the people said no, the elected goverment was elected to do what the voters want, so them ignoring them is bad. So at the time my argument stands. In a few years then we converse. It is a valid argument until it changes. Also you forget on the second ballot they have independant country or state. ONLY if it passes the first one, which it won't because of the poll, and IF it gets to the second and then it has a fight for independence, and the commonwealth people will go and vote independance as common wealth is more independant then state, and they would go with their 2nd best thing. So it would be unlikely that it would pass. [2]
 
 
   "They have a non-voting commissioner in congress. He may express what is thought could help Puerto Rico, but, he cannot vote and thus truly has no say in matters relating to Puerto Rico."  
 
 Yes but why do they need to vote as the federal goverment doesn't affect puerto rico that often:
 
  do not pay federal income taxes on wages earned in Puerto Rico. [2]
 
 
 C1: economic detriment
 
 
 
 unemployment:     15.7      [3]
 
 
 In May 2007, local economists expressed serious concerns when it was revealed that the Puerto Rico public debt equaled 76% of its gross national product (GNP), making it one of the most indebted countries by percentage in the world,  [4]
 
 we really don't need an extra ounce of debt
 
 
 
 C2: Language
 
 well proven. Here's how it hurts:
 
      Language is the most obvious difference between the US and Puerto Rico.  That's the reason, perhaps, that both conservatives and liberals speak about the linguistic differences as the evident cultural difference between both societies.  However, the problem is deeper than this.  Some statehood advocates say that in a few decades, the Latin minority will dominate US society, requiring some states to have Spanish as an official language in some states.  This would lead us closer to the United States. [6]
 
 
 
 
 
 C3: Politics
 
 proven that it would affect
 
 C4: already considered americans
 
 proven, but I will do more as some still probably would deny:
 
 
 Puerto Rico is a territory (Commonwealth) of the United States of America and Puerto Ricans have common citizenship, currency and defense. Although Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, residents of Puerto Rico pay no federal income tax, nor can they vote in presidential elections. As citizens, Puerto Ricans do not require a work visa (also known as green cards) to live and/or work in the United States. Over 2 million Puerto Ricans live in the United States, primarily in the northeast. [5]
 
 proven.
 
 
 C5: the people don't want it
 
 PROVEN and he conceded the poll to me. 
 
 ==conclusion==
 
 My mom is from puerto rico, I am in a devils advocate, but based on the debate so far my arguments are stronger and supported with facts. Vote con!
