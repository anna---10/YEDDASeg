TITLE: Should The 2nd Amendment be Removed or Altered for the Modern Era?

CATEGORY: Politics

Hello and thanks for starting this debate! To begin, I will actually cite the second amendment.
 "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."
 
 I would not remove, rather just summarize this text so it is less open to interpretation. As a person who believes in the 2nd amendment, and to someone who appreciates firearms, I also understand that our system is flawed. So many people have weapons who should not have weapons. See this article:  http://abcnews.go.com... 
 
 It goes in depth with the number of missing firearms. These statistics are inappropriate, and irresponsible. Now a days, any one can just walk into a gun store and purchase a firearm. This gives the good folks with firearms a bad name. The second amendment should look something along the lines of: "Firearm licenses are to be dealt with by the federal government to prevent inappropriate use of firearms. Missing firearms are to be found within 48 hours of going missing, and the firearms dealer will be held responsible (along with the criminal ) for any crimes committed with said firearm". I chose to say the federal government should regulate this, simply because states have a long history of disagreeing over licenses. If we start to hold gun dealers responsible for their mistakes, then less preventable crime will happen. Also, guns don't just go missing.
 
 Thank you, and to reaffirm, I don't want to take weapons away from the appropriate audience, nor do I want to make it harder for the right people to have guns. It's the people who are unfit to own firearms that should not have access.
