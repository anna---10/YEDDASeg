TITLE: States rights to nullification of laws, regulations, or executive or congressional acts.

CATEGORY: Politics

On your first highlighted quote, I was not speaking on slavery. I was going off what you said in your previous argument.
 
 On your second highlighted quote, I failed to mention my voting plan I would love to have in my state. I never mentioned anything when it comes to voting, which is what Con implies speaking of 49% vs. 51%. May I present a video explaining the alternative vote, which is the best way to appease the most people.

 On your third highlighted quote, it is not a possibility under the states rights to nullify because, as said before, they would not be able to nullify the 27 amendments, I was using slavery as a example, probbably not the most appropriate example, but an example nonetheless.
 
 On my closing statement. I'd like to stress the importance of the most freedom as possible for the people, this is what state nullification would allow. Any law, regulation, executive action or congressional action would be allowed to become null and void by any state. The states, however would not be able to nullify the 27 amendments, a nationwide draft, or internal military orders. This is the best way to ensure the ultimate freedom for people. The alrernative vote also ensures this where voting is involved.
