TITLE: The Strategic Bombing and use of the A-bomb against Japan in World War 2 was Unjustified

CATEGORY: Politics

The US bombing of Japan was necessary and in fact saved lives. It was not like the German bombing of London by any stretch of the imagination. It was unfortunate, cruel, and a terrible thing, but it was justified by all means. And here's why:
 
 We were at war. And we needed to bring Japan to it's knees for what it did at Pearl Harbor and throughout East Asia in the 30's and 40's. When you are attacked, you can't sit on your hands. You have to respond in kind, a hundredfold. You have to respond in a manner that will prevent you and your people from ever being attacked again. You have to dissuade further attacks. Otherwise you are directly complicit because you showed the world that your nation does not have the courage to stand up when it is knocked down.
 
 Thus, we needed to bring Japan to it's knees. And the best way to do that was through Strategic Bombing and use of the Atomic Bomb. The Japanese were still a powerful war machine, and it is estimated that Operation Downfall (the planned invasion of Japan) would have cost millions of lives on both sides. Japanese children were given manuals on how to kill American soldiers with school supplies. The Japanese were told to each kill 10 Americans before going down. These were a people that were ready to fight to the death. And thus, landing in Japan would have been bloody, costly, and terrible, more so than the strategic bombings.
