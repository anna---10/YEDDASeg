TITLE: renewable energy is the best solution for energy worldwide.

Environmental effects of non-renewable sources  
 
 I do not contend against the fact that coal and oil have contributed to global warming and cause pollution, as it is true. However, I do contend that nuclear energy is not as harmful as Pro has claimed, and that so-called "renewable" energy can be environmentally unfriendly as well.
 
 Various companies in the solar panel industry have created tens of millions of pounds of hazardous waste from creating solar panels [1]. Geothermal energy produces CO2 emissions as well [1]. All renewable sources have effects on nearby wildlife, such as wind turbines killing birds and dams destroying wildlife reserves [1].
 
 I do not claim these environmental effects are worse than those of oil and coal, however, it should be considered that renewable sources are not perfect either.
 
 It is true that people in nuclear plants are exposed to radiation. What is failed to be taken in account, however, is the fact that a minimum of 100.00 mSv of radiation is required for there to be an observable increase in cancer. Even then, an exposure to 1000.00 mSv of radiation was necessary before it was observed that 5% of people contracted cancer in later years [2]. Even the radiation around Fukushima was only around 400.00 mSv- a normal nuclear plant will not be harmful. It is true that accidents can happen, but in general all are the result of poor design and maintenance, which can be easily mitigated by proper caution. In the past sixty years, there's only been around thirty accidents, and most of them were low on the lower half of the nuclear accident scale [3].
 
 The waste from nuclear plants is an issue, but can be mitigated by a shift to thorium plants, that produce less hazardous waste, and its hazardous waste cannot be use to forge weapons [4].
 
   Viability of renewable sources  
 
 All renewable sources are very location specific, in particular geothermal and hyrdro- a relatively small number of sites around the world have the potential to provide energy of that form. Nowhere in the study Pro cites about geothermal energy is it claimed that geothermal energy could power the world- only that it could provide some amount of energy. In fact, for example, looking at a geothermal resource map of the US, it can be seen that only the West Coast in general can easily host geothermal plants [5].
 
 Solar power is also harmful to existing electrical grids, overloading them due to overproduction during daytime [6]. And during nighttime, when electricity is most needed, solar power is unavailable, due to the fact that it has not been possible to create an economically-viable, efficient battery to store solar energy- salt-based storage only has less than 20% efficiency [7], The same problem lies with wind power, which is just as difficult to store on a large scale. There are certainly other batteries available, but they are terrible expensive (around $1000/kWh, when the average fridge uses 5 kWh a day for comparison) [8]. Even if a economically-viable, efficient storage system was created, however, its very existence would mean that "renewable" energy would be reliant on environmentally-unfriendly non-renewable substances. The biggest problem with solar and wind is storing it.
 
 On an economic level, renewable sources of energy are generally non-viable compared to non-renewable sources, as non-renewable sources often provide much more energy for a lower cost [9].
 
 Thus in all, at the moment, renewable sources are unfortunately non-viable as a replacement for non-renewable sources.
 
 Thanks for having me. Back to you now.
