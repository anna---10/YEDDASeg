TITLE: Is democracy the best type of government there is?

CATEGORY: Politics

They say that democracy is a type of government where the majority rules. When majority rules, there can be a lot of mistakes such as electing a wrong person for a leader etc...... I think that a small number of wise, intelligent, fair people would be much better than leaving people's destiny to a system called democracy, where a larger number of people rules, and a small number of people is ignored, and let them be alone.
