TITLE: Animal Abuse Should Be a Severe Felony

CATEGORY: Society

Now that you stated a very well written argument; here is my response.
 
 You stated that seial killers and physcopaths probably mistreeted animals when they were children. The reason for that is because psychopaths' brains have less grey matter in the anterior rostral prefrontal cortex and temporal poles than the brains of the non-psychopathic offenders and non-offenders. These areas of the brain are important for understanding other people's emotions and intentions, and are activated when people think about moral behaviour. So if these parts of the brain are not activitaded then the pshyco is more apt to do things like hurt animals. So with that in mind than here is an statement. People with mental problems should not be out on the streets and should be locked up or euthanized; whatever the preference. Sorry to get off topic but I felt it was necessary to point that out. Also I felt that in your previous answer that you still haven't answered the burden of proof that animal abuse should be a severe penalty. How severe? What would the criteria be for a basic punishment? Are there any variations on punishment based upon the severity of the crime. Following that I rest my case until your next response.
