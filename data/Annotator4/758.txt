TITLE: Is modern day feminism good?

CATEGORY: Politics

Yes, there will always be people who will prove what you just said right and at the moment, people are focusing at them more than the others. The people who you are talking about right now are going mainstream and causing people to forget the majority of feminists; women and men who just want equal rights.
 One of the main issues that the 3rd wave of feminism is concerned with is the wage gap. Honestly, I am not convinced that there is a wage gap; factors such as hours worked, position, quality of work has much to do with it and I don't think we have yet the right information to conclude from. Yes, there are some "femi-nazis" like Minddagger pointed out , that take things too far but that's not the majority.
 Please tell me what's wrong with the pu**y hats. They don't show anything vulgur or anything explicit that a kid won't see on one of the many sexual ads that taint the television.
 Before I refute the last sentence fully, could you specify the hate speech and maybe use examples?
