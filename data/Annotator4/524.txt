TITLE: Will 'Gun Control Laws' Really Help?

CATEGORY: Politics

I believe that making guns under control will greatly benefit society. For example, stores that sell firearms would have to do a background check on the said person. Police would also benefit from these laws because they would be exempt from the gun control laws, which in turn would make it easier to capture the said criminal. Here is quote of what happens when you allow guns into normal society "This year will go down in history. For the first time, a civilized nation has full gun registration. Our streets will be safer, our police more efficient, and the world will follow our lead into the future"! - Adolph Hitler, 1935, on The Weapons Act of Nazi Germany
 
 We should all know what happened to Germany when gun control was not enforced. The exact opposite of what Adolph Hitler stated what would happen.
