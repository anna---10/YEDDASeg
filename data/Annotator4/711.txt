TITLE: It will either, rain or not rain.

CATEGORY: Science

You used the word "chance" so you obviously made some claim about probability
 
 1 spot of rain = 100%. Just as a downpour = 100%. NO. the chance of raining does not refer to the amount of rain. meteorologists collect snapshots of the weather. each snapshot contains info such as temp, pressure, humidity... 20% chance meaning 20 out of 100 times the atmosphere demonstrate these parameters, it rains.
