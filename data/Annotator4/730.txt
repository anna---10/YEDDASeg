TITLE: Euthanasia is unethical

CATEGORY: Society

I will not be posting any rebuttals in this round, only my beginning arguments. 
 I will be providing four arguments as to why euthanasia should be considered ethical. 
 
  Quality of Life 
 For the terminally ill, there is virtually no quality of life whatsoever. Not only is severe pain a large part of this, but also other physical ailments such as incontinence, nausea and vomiting, breathlessness, paralysis, and difficulty swallowing.[1] These issues will never go away for the terminally ill, and it makes them feel like a burden to their loved ones, thus making their quality of life even worse. 
 
 There is a reason that euthanasia is considered “mercy killing," and if I was ever put in the position of knowing that I wasn’t going to live, and I was completely dependant on the care of other people, I would be very grateful of having the choice to end it. 
 
  Impossibility of Survival 
 The definition of terminal is approaching or close to death: being in the final stages of a fatal disease.[2]
 
 Euthanasia is only to be carried out when the patient in question has a terminal illness, so therefore, has no chance of survival. There is no point in prolonging the suffering of a fatally ill person when they are going to die anyways. It would be considered a kindness to give the choice of death. 
 
  Costs 
 In 2009, it cost between $50,000 and $100,000 to keep a terminally ill patient alive in their last days.[3] In 2013, a day in the intensive care unit of a hospital when the treatment was futile cost an average of $4,004 per patient.[4] 
 
 I understand that it seems wrong to put a monetary value on a human life, but when that life is going to end anyways, it would be less of a financial burden on the family for the person to be euthanized.
 
  Dignity In Death 
 Euthanasia assures the patient that they will be able to die in dignity. Not everybody is given the choice as to how they will die, and it is a tremendous opportunity when that choice is given. Someone would feel a lot better in dying if they chose how it was done, rather than just waiting for a disease to end it for them.
