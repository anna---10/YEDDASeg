TITLE: Keeping God Out of Elections

CATEGORY: Politics

Though it is an effective campaign strategy, I think that God and religion should be left out of elections all together. In certain cases, the power of religion can be an unfair advantage for the candidates running and I am afraid that one day the bible belt would be deciding elections and further move our country into regression when it comes to medical and social evolution. Furthermore, the use of religion can make a candidates views and political policies cloudy when there is a huge religious stigma surrounding their campaign. Religion can, in my opinion, steer a candidate away from getting to the real issues that a country may be facing.
