TITLE: term limits

CATEGORY: Politics

In an election usually the the person already in office will win again because people have more knowledge of that person. Also if the person already sitting in power wins, it may become a totalitarian regime once they decide to give them self's more power systematically. If you have term limits you'll probably be more likely to get more ideas much faster. Also it may break ties to special interest groups. So if you have the biggest company's behind you you'll never lose. Just bribe the people to keep their mouths shut and support you. The ways dictatorships start is either being rich, or very well armed people behind you, and being rich helps get those arms behind you. So term limits will help reduce the size of government in good ways.
 
 This makes elections more fair also. when its two people who are not well known, the chances are 50% for each, where as the person currently sitting in power has a 90% chance of winning. It also makes taxes lower because if there are people who raise them, you just vote them out (which can be hard as I have said because they have more influence) or wait till their limit ends. It can also reduce power lobby's because if you have 10 senior members ruling everything that's not always good. But with term limits this can only happen for a limited amount of time.
