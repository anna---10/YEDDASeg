TITLE: Historical parallel

CATEGORY: Politics

First post so sorry if it seems like I"m just feeling my way thru:
 I was trying to draw a parallel to another historical figure that had rallies after the race.
 Somehow I was expecting a pro trump to jump all over it.
 I was just wanting to state my observation that there was once an elected head of state that did the same thing.
 Wouldn"t be the first to do it, but this one seems ominously close to something that I will be held accountable for even though I railed against it.
 Similar nature To illustrate: At a political rally I say any dissenters take them out and beat them up I will pay for your legal expenses. Lock up my dissenters. I don"t have to pay taxes i"m the fuhrer. Someone other than our own people is to blame. Separate the parents from the children so they put up less of a fight, then separate the women from the men so the men put up less of a fight, then gas them all
