TITLE: Death Penalty

CATEGORY: Politics

When comparing the death penalty to the average inmate, yes of course, the costs are much higher. But what you are failing to compare is the costs of those facing a sentence of Life Without Parole (LWOP) for similar crimes. Life without parole prisoners face, on average, 30 or 40 years in prison with an annual cost of incarceration about $34,500 each year (TIME magazine). Couple this staggering amount with a very similar number of appeals hearings and you have a MUCH higher total. Justice for All (JFA) reports that death penalty cases average around $2 million with an average of 6 years in appeals courts, while the LWOP prisoners average around $2-3.6 million with 8-12 years in appeals courts. Short term, more expensive, but long term, considerably less. And in regards to "eye for an eye". The point of the DP is not to teach ethics or prove a point. It is to rid society of criminals who are beyond rehabilitation. Serial killers have permanent mental defects, not character flaws.
