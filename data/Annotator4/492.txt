TITLE: These scenarios ought to be treated equally in the eyes of the law.

CATEGORY: Politics

Teachers employed by public high schools should be strictly prohibited by a law governing the contracts by which teachers may be signed from options 1 and 3, yet not options 2 and 4 (e.g. it should be illegal to sign a teacher without a clause that prohibits heterosexual student-teacher sex, and, naturally, illegal for them to violate this clause).
 
 The reason for this is that they are creating a risk of pregnancy. Teachers impregnating students or being impregnated by students ensures that both ends of the system result in a highly precarious situation-- A pregnancy or an abortion are both rather bad for academic performance, and a teacher is paid to ensure high academic performance of his students. A mere afterglow is nothing compared to the distraction of either of these possibilities, especially when BOTH parties are distracted and so neither can help snap the other out of it.
