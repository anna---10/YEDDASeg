TITLE: Monarchies are superior than Republics

CATEGORY: Politics

I Guess I will start by addressing the same issues and also expanding with the Representation.
 
 1)Political stability
 Monarchies are the opposite of political stability, In a Republic sure the leader is subject to their party, HOWEVER there is more than one political leader. Thus representation is shared and thus equal. Leaders are not bought and we can see that in american elections, Obama was overspent by several hundred thousand dollars and still won. In a monarchy the leader is corrupt and subject only to their opinion. NEVER BEFORE IN HISTORY HAS A MONARCHY WORKED AND BENEFITED ITS PEOPLE! ALL MONARCHIES AS OF PRESENT ARE EITHER STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE OR GONE. Stability in a monarchy is achieved simply by killing any opposition, hording resources, and forcing people below you into poverty.
 
 YOUR WHOLE CONTENTION ASSUMES ALL MONARCHIES ARE NEUTRAL, that's not how monarchies work. They are simply composed of a leader that looks out for his own good only trying to empower himself. They do not care what they have to do to achieve it. This is proved with Hobbes' law of nature, a monarchy is a clear example when law of man is ignored and we are placed into a state of nature, or chaos, NO MAN CAN BELIEVE HE IS ABOVE THE LAW no matter how talented or skilled. Thus your Contention falls apart.
 
 2) Political corruption
 This is absurd argument, Warlords run the same government of fear Monarchies use and are the definition of corrupt, they accept funds to sway opinion, CORRUPTION IS NOT TO FAVOR A PARTY ALONE, IT REQUIRES A BRIBE OF SOME SORT. So again, a republic where Parliament exist show equal representation of the people, thus equality is spread unlike in a monarchy.
 
 3)Economy
 This argument is so far out there I'm almost sad your arguing this, The only argument I needs bring against this is GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE OF THIS WORKING, All the examples in the past have LEAD TO REBELLION, REVOLUTION, DEATH, AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A REPUBLIC. Current examples of working republics; USA, UK, Germany, Japan, South Korea, France, ect.
 
 4)Legitimacy
 This is also a ridiculous argument, Monarchies are the farthest thing from a legitimate government. a monarchy is 0% of votes for someone to be able to be unchecked and able to rule in any way they wish. A republic has a parliament or congress to check up on leaders and control the authority of the leaders.
 
 5)Representation
 This does not exist in a monarchy! Representation leads to prosperity of the people and allow minorities that are in poverty to advance.
