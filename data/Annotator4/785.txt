TITLE: Western feminism has failed

CATEGORY: Politics

Although there are problems with gender equality with women, the same thing happens with men. For example, men will get longer prison sentences than women for the same crime. [1] Men are also more likely to commit suicide than women. [2] Feminism is not for men. It is purely for women. As Google defines, feminism is "the advocacy of women's rights on the grounds of political, social, and economic equality to men."
 
 One point my opponent makes is the so-called "wage gap." However, that is a myth. The thing that people who make those statistics fail to take into account is how much time each gender normally works, which gender generally puts more time into their career which gender is more likely to put their children over their job, and other things as well. If we include all of these factors, the wage gap disappears. [3]
 
 The "first seven weeks" statistic my oponent claims is true cannot be valid because it only makes an estimate based on only the first seven weeks of an entire year. It also only considers what has been reported. Men could have also been killed due to domestic violence, but it hasn't been reported. One should not judge society based on the actions of 13 men.
