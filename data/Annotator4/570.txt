TITLE: Young-Earth Creationism

CATEGORY: Science

1 The Bible does not tell us that Noah and his sons built the Ark by themselves. Noah could have hired skilled laborers or had relatives, such as Methuselah and Lamech, help build the vessel. However, nothing indicates that they could not""or that they did not""build the Ark themselves in the time allotted. The physical strength and mental processes of men in Noah"s day was at least as great (quite likely, even superior) to our own. They certainly would have had efficient means for harvesting and cutting timber, as well as for shaping, transporting, and erecting the massive beams and boards required.
  I say they COULD build them, but my problems are:
 
 1. Where did all the water come from?
 2. How did the animals fit into a boat 1/3 the Titanic's size?
 3. How did humanity repopulate with a only few incestuous humans in 4000 years?
 4. How did animals repopulate?
 5. How did all the animals spread from one area to areas across oceans?
 _____________________________________________________________
  There is no word for it in the Hebrew language. If you think about it, why would God talk about an extinct group of species in his creation.
  See next section.

  Far from proving evolution, carbon-14 dating actually provides some of the strongest evidence for creation and a young earth. For information on this particular evolution lie, check this out to disprove those myths 
 You are partially correct. Carbon 14 does dissipate too quickly to accurately date objects over 50,000 years.
 
 However, due to this, scientist use several methods, such as uranium dating, to see that the planet is about 4.5 billion years old, a far cry from a measly 6000 years.
 
 How would the dinosaurs be 6000 years old if uranium, much more slowly dissipating, says 65 million years old?
