TITLE: Anger is a dangerous emotion and should be dispelled from society

CATEGORY: Society

I thank my opponent for starting this original and interesting debate - I'm sure it will turn out great. On a more personal note, I am pleased to see that my opponent likes death metal. It automatically boosts here "cool meter" up 3 notches ;D. Now onto the debate:
 
 ==========
 Anger is many times, if not always, counterproductive to intelligent discourse
 ==========
 
 This is a debating website, and most of us understand the importance of intelligent discourse. Countless communities and people engage in this act. Politicians everywhere, from Congress to our President. Activists and political opponents. College campuses and scientific communities. Philosophical circles and critical thinkers. Intelligent discourse surrounds many aspects of our lives, and helps produce well-furnished ideas and compromises. Just imagine how much better people will be at debating, and exchanging intelligent ideas, without emotions getting in the way? Not only will being calm give people a better way of communicating in intelligent discourse, but it can also serve to remove bias. If someone is personally angered by an issue (death penalty or gay marriage), then this can very easily cloud their judgment. By removing anger, the world can be one step closer to being rid of ignorance and clouded judgements.
 
 ==========
 Anger prevents many crimes from occurring
 ==========
 
 How many crimes have happened in the heat of passion? COUNTLESS! Many crimes are caused by a streak of anger, ranging from physical assault, to reckless driving, to even murder. By removing anger, society in general can benefit greatly. I dare say I need not develop this point more, as it is evident. By removing anger, we remove a substantial portion of crime - a goal that any well-driven society should strive for.
 
 ==========
 Anger hurts and/or causes tension for many personal relationships
 ==========
 
 On a more personal level, countless of friendships and relationships have been damaged by someone's anger. A quick temper can lead to hostility from others or a sudden but rare moment of being mad may damage a marriage or a couple - something that is tragic and should be avoided. By removing anger, more relationships can be intact and therefore more people will be happy.
 
 ==========
 Conclusion
 ==========
 
 These are only 3 of my points now. If I feel that there are more points to bring into awareness, than I may do so in the following rounds (seeing as how this is a 5-round debate). Until then, these points should be adequate to carry my position through. I await my opponent's response.
