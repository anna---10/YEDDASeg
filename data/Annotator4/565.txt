TITLE: Should guns be banned in America?

CATEGORY: Politics

That is not true. Banning guns in America is definitely going to decrease the crime rate. Banning knifes? That is nonsense. And logical speaking, crimes with guns are much more threatening than crimes with knifes. This is because, if the person who is being attacked have done some kind of martial arts, they could possibly defend themselves against crimes with knifes. However, there is no way that anyone can defend themselves against guns. Yes, i agree that the 2nd amendment allows ownership of weapons for citizen, but i think it's necessary to put a stop to citizens killing other citizens with bullets.
