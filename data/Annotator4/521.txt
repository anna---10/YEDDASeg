TITLE: Both letters from "Disgusted White Girl" and "Black Royalty" are racist and/or misinformed.

CATEGORY: Society

I acknowledge that DWG was merely "quoting" her boyfriend (ha). However just because the words may or may not have been her own does not negate the fact that the CONTENT of her letter was racist, regardless of who said it. DWG was obviously "misinformed" by her boyfriend. Thus, her letter = racist and misinformed.
 
 I believe I have already addressed the misinformation of BR's words in previous rounds. For instance, he claimed that white people were over in Europe "beating each other over the head with clubs" while black queens ruled over Egypt. That is blatantly untrue. He is misinformed. His letter provides misinformation. Plus, some of his statements were blatantly racist as well. He writes, "Nowadays, in my opinion, a lot of brothers date white women because they are docile and easy to control." That is his opinion - fine. But later he writes, "Bottom Line: If I were looking for a docile woman, someone I can walk over and control, I would give you a call." That statement is rooted in prejudice. He is assuming that DWG is docile BECAUSE she is a white woman. Hence, racism.
 
 So, in conclusion, both letters contain racism and misinformation. You have not and cannot prove otherwise.
