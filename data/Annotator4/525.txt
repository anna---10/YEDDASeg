TITLE: Republicans passed the civil rights bill and LBJ was a racist

CATEGORY: Politics

I am going to keep this short
 
 JFK was a democrat, most democrats have liberal values, therefore JFK was a liberal.
 
 LBJ not racist for saying "negros" if he is than we are both racist because we both wrote it. Are you a racist?
 
 still waiting on republicans passing civil rights bill.
