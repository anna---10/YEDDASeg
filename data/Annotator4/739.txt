TITLE: Cheaters using the name of charity to solicit money from people.

CATEGORY: Society

I am against these people mainly because I think they denounce the Charities. There are really many charities who need help out there, but these people just use the name for their personal advantage. There should be something done to stop these people from denouncing those charities who really need help from citizens like us.
