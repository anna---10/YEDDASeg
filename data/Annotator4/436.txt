TITLE: Should Senator Bernie Sanders be the democratic primary nominee?

CATEGORY: Politics

Bernie Sanders should be the democratic nominee. This is not a debate about whether he /will/, it is about who you would vote for just to be clear.
 
 1. Bernie Sanders supports almost all the same things as Hillary Clinton, but shoots higher. Now, this doesn't mean that he isn't willing to compromise, it just means he has perspective. I think a lot of people believe that Senator Sanders is too radical, but he just knows what is right. And he does have plans for how to accomplish his claims. For example, he proposed a tax on wall street. I know this will not fix everything, but it shows that he does know that things do not just happen. He is not stupid, he has worked in government for a long time. And I think people forget that sometimes.
 
 2. Although many people claim that he will not be able to beat Cruz or Trump in the general election, polls put him as much as 20 points in front of Trump in my state alone. It is ridicules to believe that Trump will win the election. If it comes down to Trump and Bernie people will vote for the candidate that is not a bully.
 
 3. The gender argument. Yes, having a woman for president would be awesome. But the whole idea people want to promote by having a female president is undermined by favoring someone in a political race because of their gender. You should consider their views, not their physical characteristics.
