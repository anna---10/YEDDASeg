TITLE: DEATH PENALTY is better than NO PENALTY

CATEGORY: Society

Good arguments.
 I will argue that it is unethical to kill anyone even if they commited a heinous crime.
 Lets run through the major religions of the world to see what they think:
 Christian/Jewish: In the hebrew scriptures (also known as the old testament) Moses comes down from a mountain with the ten commandments for his people that he rescued from Eygpt. One of the ten states, "Thou Shall Not Kill."
 Muslim: The Quran states, "Do Not Take Life, Which The Allah Has Made Sacred..."
 Hindu: The Veda states, "You must not use your God-given body for killing God's creatures,
 whether they are human, animal or whatever."
 Buddhist: The Dhammpada states, "Do not kill or cause kill."
 Just those five top religions in the world make up seventy-four percent of the world and none of those promote killing any humans. In fact I don't know any religion that promotes killing humans. Only 16 percent of the world is atheist meaning that there is only 16 percent of the world that MIGHT promote killing other humans.
 I look forward to your rebuttal.
