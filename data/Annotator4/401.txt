TITLE: If teachers are allowed to strike, should firemen, policemen and paramedics be allowed to strike?

CATEGORY: Society

It sounds like your argument is that since policemen and firemen are  not  alowed to strike, neither should teahcers, which is confusing based on the debate title. If that is, in fact, your argument, here is my rebuttle: I think it should be the opposite. All government employees, such as teachers, policemen, and firemen, should be allowed to strike, and it is  because  they serve critical roles in society that if they are receiving an unfair wage or benefits, they should be allowed to protest it. if someone has a critical job in our society, they ought to have a large wage and good job benefits, and if the government doesn't give them these things, they should be able to strike for them.
