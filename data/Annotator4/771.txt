TITLE: The U.S should attack North Korea

CATEGORY: Society

I very much agree with you in how NK can't affect the U.S. But like I said, leaving them alone won't do anything but make there "tiny" threat grow larger and larger until it's a big one.    
     Also Like how you said It's not only the U.S's problem, how about other nations that can't defend themselves. Are we going to wait until our allies are attacked, or attack the enemy first.    
     NK must realise sooner or later that they're no match for the U.S, so they could change their aim at an easier target, or take advantage of the time the U.S isn't intervening. I understand the U.S is occupied, but if they're so much stronger than NK, why don't they get the highest potential threat over with while they're weak.    
     What do you think the U.S or other UN allies should do?
