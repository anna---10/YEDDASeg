TITLE: Should Women be drafted into the (American) Military?

CATEGORY: Politics

Personally, I believe that you do not have to be gender-specific in order to have the "potential" to be drafted into one of the military branches of the United States. If you want to become a soldier, you don't have to necessarily be a male in order to do so, and I think that people should acknowledge that women nowadays are looking forward to equality, which includes taking a position in the United States military. Since women are genetically more intelligent than men, I believe that a woman will do a much better job at taking a position in the U.S. military that requires intellectual abilities.
