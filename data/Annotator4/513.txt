TITLE: Should Gay people have the right to marry.

CATEGORY: Society

Point 1: The USA was vaguely founded on Christian principles, and the Bible is still used today, for the purpose of swearing presidents into office. The Bible says that "Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination." This essentially states that gay marriage is not to be legal. Your argument is that people are created equal, to which I agree. But your argument did not include marriage equality. Historically, marriage was between a man and a woman, not between man and man, or woman and woman. The goal of human sex is to reproduce, which is the same in all of nature. Gay marriages do not allow for children to be born, as one parent lacks the compatible sex organ. I argue that a child has a right to grow up with a father and a mother, and to raise him or her in a gay or lesbian household is to deny him that right.
