TITLE: America went to the moon

CATEGORY: Science

The Lunar landings have been spotted by China"s Chang"e 2 lunar probe, the Indian Chandrayaan-1 probe, and various other independent (non NASA-funded) space agent. To celebrate the 40th anniversary of the landings NASA put together a series of remastered images and footage of the Apollo 11 mission. The images are stunning, and blow away the age-old criticism that the Apollo footage was somehow intentionally bad to obscure the fact it was filmed in a studio.
