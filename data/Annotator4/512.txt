TITLE: Bernie Sanders tax on the rich won't work

CATEGORY: Politics

You say we should all pay a fair share. 50% on the rich, 5% on the root isn't fair. Taxing some at different percentages isn't fair at all. Taxing everyone at 10% is fair. The working poor are working in America and deserve to pay something. Fair isn't some workers paying high percents, and some workers paying a little. Fair is everybody paying the same.
 
 As for you saying the rich won't move out if they are taxed at 50% . This is flawed. Why wouldn't one move to a place where they are taxed 10 instead of 50%? Why would Europe be hostile for rich people? Rich people bring money and better government revenue. You say a lower tax on the rich would lower government revenue, and 50% tax would increase it. In theory, like many socialist policies, this seems great. The problem is, the rich don't want to be treated unfairly and will move to a country where they are taxed fairly and less.
 
 About Bernie trying to control world trade and tax things. If he doesn't allow the rich to store assets overseas (I'm not saying it's a good thing) won't that be another reason to leave America? You say leaving won't be possible under Bernie. That seems very communist and dictatorship-like. I'm sure if he says "nobody can leave" he will be impeached. Let's say an air conditioner company moves from the US to Mexico. European countries did trade with that company, they wouldn't be trading with the US anymore. What will happen under this high tax is rich people will leave, factories will leave (for many reasons other then taxes) and trade won't be with America anymore cause there won't be anything in America worth trading. Simply put, the Bernie tax drives people away from America.
