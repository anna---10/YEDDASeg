TITLE: Should Guns be Banned?

CATEGORY: Politics

1) Benefits of Gun Ownership
 
 I will begin by outlining the benefits of gun ownership. There are only two benefits commonly associated with gun ownership: recreation and self-defense. Recreation will refer to any activity involving gun-use with the primary purpose of entertainment. Self-defense will refer to using a gun to defend oneself, family, or property from an unlawful assailant.
 
 Recreation is not a serious argument for the continued allowance of guns. It is absurd to think that something should be permitted just because there exists a party that takes satisfaction from its use. If we were to assume that the mere enjoyment of something merited its licitness, we would have to allow anything that could possibly be enjoyed. I feel examples are not necessary to demonstrate such a simple point. After all, if that were the case, then we would have to allow activities such as murder and rape.
 
 This leaves us with self-defense. Already you can see that the legitimate defenses of gun-ownership are quite limited; it's really just the one point. However, this point does not exist in a vacuum, and we must weigh its utility against the data.
 
 2) Detriments of Gun Ownership
 
 So, let's compare: According to FBI statistics for the year 2014, 90 criminals were killed justifiably by a gun-wielding private citizen{1}. Comparatively, 2,443 homicides were committed by firearms the same year{2}. (It is worth noting in these figures that the number of gun related homicides is more than 1.5x greater than all other types of homicide combined) This data displays the ratio of private citizens defending life and liberty with firearms to criminals using them exclusively for homicide to be approximately 1:27. While I find this statistic by itself to be unacceptable, a more comprehensive overview indicates the situation is even worse. The CDC lists total gun fatalities for 2014 as 33,599{3}. This means that the ratio of lethal firearm self-defense cases against all lethal firearm uses is
 actually 1:373.
 
 This estimate does include firearm suicides, which some will claim shouldn't be used for this type of comparison, but there is strong evidence that it is, in fact, relevant: "We pooled data from 14 identified observational studies that assessed the odds of suicide and, using a random-effects model, calculated a pooled OR of 3.24 (95% CI, 2.41 to 4.40) with substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 89%; `4; = 0.45). All but 1 study found significantly higher odds of suicide among participants who had firearm access than among those who did not, with ORs ranging from 1.38 to 10.38."{4} This study suggests that there is a significant correlation among gun ownership and suicide. This is consistent with other findings that show that suicidies are often impulsive acts, and ease of accessibility to a quick life-ending method can be a major deciding factor in whether or not the impulse is carried out{5}.
 
 Not surprising, then, that studies have discovered some correlation between impulse and aggression{6}. It doesn't take much deduction to see that if ease of access to the proper tool can increase risk of an impulsive activity like suicide, then it may be able to increase risk of an impulsive activity like murder. This would help explain why the U.S has a higher rate of gun and non-gun fatalities than many other developed countries{7},{8}.
 
 3) Conclusion
 
 Given the paucity of benefits that are derived from private arms ownership and the high level of violence associated with it, I believe it's logical to restrict gun access for the general public.
