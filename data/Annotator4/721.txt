TITLE: Should America elect a bland, uncharismatic, and forgettable president?

CATEGORY: Politics

Let's define the terms being used in the resolution.
 
 Should:
  http://www.oxforddictionaries.com... 
 Used to indicate obligation, duty, or correctness, typically when criticizing someone's actions
 
 Bland:
  http://www.oxforddictionaries.com... 
 Lacking strong features or characteristics and therefore uninteresting
 
 Uncharismatic:
  http://www.oxforddictionaries.com... 
 Lacking the charm and attractiveness that can inspire enthusiasm in others
 
 Forgettable:
  http://www.oxforddictionaries.com... 
 Easily forgotten, especially through being uninteresting or mediocre
 
 If the person is easily forgettable, they'd be forgotten by the election by the majority of people of average memory capacity or below. If the person is bland, they wouldn't attract voters to begin with, nor make office. If the person is uncharismatic, they wouldn't have the capability to motivation anyone to vote them in the first place.
 
 Thus, by definition, to win an election means that a person cannot be all three of those things.
