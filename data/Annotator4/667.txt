TITLE: Donald Trump should release his tax returns.

CATEGORY: Politics

You hope for more information on both candidates but do not wish to put in the time to do your research. Regarding Uranium, here you go. [1]
 
 I would like to point out that google does not allow you to search up articles regarding the topic, so you have to search it up on bing because we live in a thought policed world.
 
 Regarding the debate and tax returns, you are right in that "no new information would be disclosed" but this really is not the case because the corrupt media (which we all know exists as evidenced by the whitewashing of any anti-Clinton work) [2] will now have the opportunity to simply write phony hit jobs regarding how Trump is an unpatriotic American because he hardly pays taxes (like any successful businessperson). I believe, like many Americans that his tax returns do not matter. While I must concede that I am by no means a tax lawyer, nor an expert in the field of taxation, the fact is that Forbes's Rob Woods has even stated that
 
 "The fact that the IRS says that Mr. Trump could decide to release the returns despite an audit does not mean that doing so would be a good idea. From a tax viewpoint, most tax lawyers have said that the tax-smart thing is for Trump not to release the returns until his audit has been completely concluded." [3]
 
 Overall, I just find it nonsensical to really put much emphasis into tax returns when there are much larger issues plaguing our candidates, nation, and world.
