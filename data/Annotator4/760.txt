TITLE: Is the invention of Nuclear Technology useful or harmful to mankind?

CATEGORY: Science

Ok. So I stand by my judgement that nuclear technology is harmful because it causes health defects, it is harmful to the environment and it is used as a WEAPON. It can kill people and that is something everybody wants to avoid. Countries who have control over these weapons may threaten to use them to kill millions of people.
