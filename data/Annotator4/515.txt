TITLE: Is Global Warming really an issue?

CATEGORY: Science

First, I would like to start off by saying that I do believe that there is a global climate change. Here are the reasons I do not believe global warming is an issue. My first reason I believe that global warming is not an issue is that, all throughout history, there have been significant climate changes.  http://www.digitaljournal.com... . This chart is an example of the different climate changes throughout history. With all those climate changes, people were able to work though it and still survive.
 
 Secondly, many people who are already worried about global warming are misinterpreting the information from the scientists. The people who do this are looking for evidence of global warming instead of looking at the evidence objectively and trying to figure out what it truly means. What I mean by this is people are just looking for reasons to say that global warming is true. But what people should be doing is looking at the big picture and seeing if this has happened in the past and figuring out ways to work through the climate change just like others did during the medieval warm period.
 
 Thirdly, weather always fluctuates. Plants and animals are able to adjust to the climate changes that occurred in the past, so they should be able to do it after this change in weather. Charles Darwin came up with a theory called Survival of the Fittest. This theory states that "species adapt and change by natural selection with the best suited mutations becoming dominant." Darwin realized that over time, climates do change and so does the world. So, as the world changes, life adapts to the new environment.
