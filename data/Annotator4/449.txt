TITLE: Resolved:That the drinking age should be eliminated

CATEGORY: Politics

In most countries over the world, the drinking age in public is between the ages of 16 to 18. Drinking in private is considered legal, unless the person is under the age of six. In the United States underage drinking is viewed as taboo, which increases the appeal for underage drinking, The fact that it is illegal for anyone under the age of 21 creates a rebellious factor applied to drinking. If the rebellious appeal is reduced then underage drinking and other problems associated with underage drinking(ie. alcoholism, drunk driving and alcohol poisoning) will be reduced considerably.
