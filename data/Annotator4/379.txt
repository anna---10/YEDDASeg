TITLE: NATO- Outdated and Unnecessary?

CATEGORY: Politics

NATO was formed with the intention of countering Soviet military influence within Europe. It now has the aim of promoting democracy and freedom within its members, and to provide a defensive reaction against any attacks. Many eastern European nations clambered to join as a defiant symbol against Russia. ( http://www.nato.int... ) With NATO gone, and in the unlikely event of Russia invading eastern Europe, would the rest of the world sit idly by and watch? Of course not. The EU certainly wouldn't allow its members and neighbours to be invaded.
 
 With the fall of the Soviet Union and the establishment of democracy throughout Europe, the requirement to have NATO disappeared. The European Union now secures its own freedom, democracy and safety, and that of its neighbours. The EU now collectively have:
 •Over 2million active personnel.
 •Nearly 10,000 tanks
 •Over 5000 fixed wing aircraft
 •Over 3000 helicopters
 •7 aircraft carriers
 •26 destroyers
 •108 frigates
 •And spends over $300billion a year on defence
 ( http://www.iss.europa.eu... )
 In short- the only military force more powerful than the EU is that of the USA. Is NATO required to protect Europe from the USA? Of course not.
 
 With two nations within the EU also having enough nuclear weapons each to knock any country out of a war, the chance of a military threat to NATO members within Europe is next to zero. The establishment of EUMS and EUFOR (although not as powerful as NATO) essentially do the same job as NATO. The USA also has no need for NATO, as its own military power provides enough defence. With neither the USA nor the EU needing NATO for protection, I feel it is time to disband the organisation.
 
 All action taken by NATO is by consensus, and with Turkey being a Muslim country, it is hard enough to get them to agree to action against Libya, let alone be a quick reactive force against external threats. NATO refused to participate in the invasion of Iraq but it went ahead anyway. So NATO clearly doesn't hold a place in the hearts and minds of any of its members. Which poses another question- why is NATO now being used to influence external politics? Has NATO strayed from defence to offence? If it has it needs to be disbanded.
 
 Could NATO be the USAs last chance of hanging on to military influence within Europe? Let's look at the figures:
 
 There are currently over 86,000 US military personnel in Europe. That is essentially the size of the British Army. ( http://siadapp.dmdc.osd.mil... )
 
 Losing that would be a bitter blow for US power projection around the area. I don't think the USA is willing to do that, even though there is no threat to Europe. NATO might be a smokescreen for USA power. In which case, if true, would call for the dissolving of NATO.
 
 NATO was formed to deal with a world order that no longer exists. It was used to ensure values now ensured by other organisations, and a defensive strategy has gradually turned into an offensive track record. A mission of peace is solely turning into political showcasing. Why should smaller NATO nations be dragged into conflicts across the globe while the USA exerts its influence. For that reason I feel NATO is past its best-by-date.
