CONTENTION ONE: OBAMA CARES
 
  I define "Obamacare" as "Obama caring about people".
 
 Obama should care about people -- if he didn't, he'd be a bad president.
 
 We don't want a bad president, do we?
 
 What if he failed to care  so badly  that he, like, nuked everyone or something?!
 
 That's bad.
 
 Vote Aff!
 
  CONTENTION TWO: OBAMACARE WORKS
 
  I'd just like to establish that Obamacare is the same thing as the Affordable Care Act, or ACA [1].
 
  SUBPOINT A: EXPANDED INSURANCE
 
  The ACA reduced the number of uninsured by 30% in one year. As the Health Policy Center states [2]:
 
  "The number of uninsured nonelderly adults fell by an estimated 10.6 million between September 2013 and September 2014 as the uninsurance rate fell from 17.7 percent to 12.4 percent—a drop of 30.1 percent. Most of the gain in coverage was among the low- and middle-income adults targeted by the ACA's Medicaid and Marketplace provisions. The uninsurance rate dropped 36.3 percent in states that implemented the ACA’s Medicaid expansion, compared with 23.9 percent in nonexpansion states; 54.7 percent of uninsured nonelderly adults lived in nonexpansion states in September 2014." 
 
 Having uninsured people is bad for the taxpayer -- $43 billion bad. As USAToday states [3]:
 
  "The average U.S. family and their employers paid an extra $1,017 in health care premiums last year to compensate for the uninsured, according to a study to be released Thursday by an advocacy group for health care consumers. Families USA, which supports expanded health care coverage, found that about 37% of health care costs for people without insurance — or a total of $42.7 billion — went unpaid last year. That cost eventually was shifted to the insured through higher premiums, according to the group."
