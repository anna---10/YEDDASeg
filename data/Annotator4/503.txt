TITLE: The USA is Europe's greatest ally.

CATEGORY: Politics

The USA is Europe's greatest ally, and it will continue to be their greatest ally for a very long period of time. I don't believe this because I'm a proud American, but because many of studies and even some presidents of European countries have said it themselves. For example, Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel has said "The United States of America is Germany's most important and powerful ally." ( http://en.wikipedia.org... )
 
 Both Europe and the US has the strongest military in the world. Putting them together as allies, doubling the amount of power and success, leaves them close to impossible to be defeated. Despite their differences in history, culture, language, and politics, they are the greatest allies the world has seen so far.
