TITLE: should president john f kennedy been assassinated

CATEGORY: Politics

Dude kennedy was bad with politics I know but he got man to land on the moon and get a man into space and have you ever read the book rocket boys a memoir of homer hickim Jr. Was the reason why we got people into space he inspired kennedy to get man on the moon he was also the best decision maker for military strategies to have us carry out operation bay pigs A.K.A. the bay of pigs incident he was the reason we avoided a nuclear disaster and I know kennedy cheated on his wife but he was younger then Nixon so he in my opinion was aloud to cheat 1 time but I know he cheated with a lot of women but who cares he ended the war on communism with Vietnam pretty much so he was a hero
