TITLE: No race is smarter than any othe race

CATEGORY: Society

The statement was very clear. "No race is smarter than any other race." Since no other information was said to elaborate, e.g. education, knowledge, ability to pick up information, the statement clearly meant "in general." Any other assumption would have been putting words into my mouth.
 
 Intelligence clearly has many factors, some of which I stated above. Regardless of which of them you argue, blacks, for example, would be at or near the bottom, with asians and jews at or near the top. That's just reality. It was caused by having the races evolve from different environments, as I stated above.
 
 Moreover, saying one race is smarter than another is NOT the same as saying I'm smarter than you. If you understood statistics, you'd know that the chance of an estimation error with EXTREMELY large races is practically 0. There is plenty of evidence that blacks are not as smart. Here is just a sampling:

 Now, we can argue the CAUSES as to why blacks are dumber, but that wasn't the debate. The debate was whether or not they were dumber, which I have proven they clearly are.
 
 You have yet to show evidence of even ONE area where blacks are smarter than average, and the only one I could even THINK of being possible would be "street smarts," but even that is HIGHLY debatable. Given that blacks have at MOST one area they accel in and a plethora of areas they are extremely far behind, it is only logical to assume that all races are not equally intelligent.
 
 And why would they be? They evolved from different places; they are different. It wouldn't make sense for them to be equally intelligent.
