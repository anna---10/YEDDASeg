Well please tell me what questions you want me to answer. So I will just give my statement. God does things that we don't understand because we can't understand. We are not perfect. What you said about the 15 year olds case. Well only god could really answer that because like I said god does things that we don't understand. God saved us by getting crucified on the cross. Which gave us all a chance to go to heaven. Also god gave us free will so we could have an arbortion or do anything else that's sinful. And he does do something which is sending is to hell. Gods vengeance is good but once again we can't understand. If god was completely fair we would all be in hell. We all sin and god didn't have to die on the cross. But he did because he loves us unconditionally. God doesn't do natural disasters. He allows them to happen to send us signs or sometimes they just happen. GOD WORKS IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS MY BROTHER!!! :)
 Note : please explain what you mean by isolated people.
