TITLE: Genetically Modified Organisms

CATEGORY: Science

GMO foods could potentially cause health problems. This is not just a guess. In 1999 a study was done in Europe by the biochemist Arpad Pustzai. It showed that rats who were fed GMO potatoes developed a weakened immune system and stomach problems. This is not the only evidence. In 2000 there was a batch of GMO corn from Starlink that had not been approved to be eaten. This corn made its way into taco shells. Some of the people who ate these taco shells had allergic reactions. Some experts said that these reactions were linked to the corn. This is just one example, if it happened once why won't it happen again? Foods that would be destined for gas or some other non edible purpose could end up on someones plate. After these incidents and studies, why should GMO foods be trusted?
 
 Questions:
 1) What heppnes to all of those hungry people if the GMO foods start to make them sick?
 2) What starving country would have enough money to pay the farmers and scientists for all of those GMO foods?
