TITLE: All children should be required to learn a second (or third) language at home or in schools

CATEGORY: Society

Of course sir, we are not going to enforce that. But for your information, you should be aware of the practicability case of the debate. You should not only focus on the necessity and benefits, but also the practicability.    For example, there is a proposal that all men should be required to go to outer space because it would enhance their understanding about the universe. Yes this proposal sounds good, but does it sound practical? NO! Just like your proposal, it has good intentions but not so possible.
  
  
  I am not saying that learning other languages is not important, but what I’m saying is that requiring ALL CHILDREN to learn another language is not so possible. Let them learn it by themselves if they want, without requiring it at home or at school.
  
  
  Your stated, “ Only speaking English in a global society will only get you so far, especially if you want to work or travel internationally. Learning more than one language is important and clearly beneficial.  ”  However, it is impossible for me or anyone to contend that learning other language is not beneficial, but I can only contend that practicability of your proposal.      Your proposal is not very possible.
