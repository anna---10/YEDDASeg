TITLE: There should be no gun laws.

CATEGORY: Politics

If you put guns in the hands of the civilians, that will lead to even more shootings. Humans are prone to make mistakes, and who knows they will not make a mistake and shoot someone. Large incidents could lead to many people being shot and the banning of guns. If we just put a limit on guns, it should never resort to this.
