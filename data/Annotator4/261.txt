TITLE: ODT: The Keystone XL Pipeline

CATEGORY: Politics

I would like to thank Contra for presenting his arguments. I apologize for taking some of the formality out of my debate, but it costs characters and time I don't have.
 
  I. Harmful Production 
 
  I.i. Job Destruction 
 
 "Other estimates advanced by supporters of the pipeline have been even more optimistic, with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce claiming it could create 250,000 permanent U.S. jobs."[1] This comes for the US Chamber of Commerce.
 
 "The Keystone XL Pipeline project is estimated to bring in $20 billion of private sector investment into the American economy, create 20,000 direct jobs, spur the creation of 118,000 spin-off jobs and pay out $5 billion in taxes to local counties over the project's lifetime."[2]
 
 Your job claims don't add up. I will get to the environmental arguments later.
 
  I.ii. Midwest Oil Prices 
 
 "The NRDC findings contradict a report last year from IHS CERA, which provides business advice and analysis to energy companies, that said the pipeline would help lower fuel prices."[3]
 
 But, what about oil exports? "TransCanada, which is building the line, says the charge is false, and Valero Energy, which would be a user of the line, says it has no intention of using the Canadian oil for export."[4] "[Oil for the pipeline will be used in] U.S. markets-not exported overseas."[5]
 
 Now admittedly, the KXL is not going to lower gas prices any more than a few cents, but my opponent is ignoring the laws of supply and demand. More supply with negligible increases in demand means lower prices. And yes, as I have proved, there will be more supply, most oil is not bound for export. And even if so, as this writer points out "it would be wise for the State Department to make them a condition for approval."[4] This would effectively eliminate fears of lower supply.
 
 Now this would eliminate these "excess oil costs" that would drown out the economic effect. What is the real economic effect? Positive.
 
 "A 2009 report from the Canadian Energy Research Institute (CERI) commissioned by the American Petroleum Institute similarly concludes that
 
 As investment and production in oil sands ramps up in Canada, the pace of economic activity quickens and demand for US goods and services increase rapidly, resulting in an estimated 343 thousand new US jobs between 2011 and 2015. Demand for U.S. goods and services continues to climb throughout the period, adding an estimated $34 billion to US GDP in 2015, $40.4 billion in 2020, and $42.2 billion in 2025.97"[5] (NOTE: This is mostly the Keystone XL Pipeline. Some is other pipelines.)
 
 Now since gas prices are decreasing a little and since at least a sizable amount of oil increasing supply, wouldn't this be a positive effect? And then we have the massive contribution to GDP and jobs.
 
 And again, I will cover environmental effects later.
 
  I.iii. Slowing Clean Energy Growth 
 
 Now, not to turn this into a green energy debate, but I will just have a short rebuttal.
 
 The KXL will indeed impede green energy job growth. But, who cares?
 
 "Suffolk County "has found jobs for only 33 percent of welfare recipients being trained under a federal grant to do 'green jobs,'" a similar effort in Seattle spent $20 million for 14 jobs."[6]
 
 Obama's $38.5 billion loan guarantee program has amounted to about 3400 new jobs, says the Washington Post. That equates to about $5 million per job.[7]
 
 So does it really matter whether or not the KXL is taking away green jobs? In fact, it seems like the KXL is doing America a favor by helping stop $5 million jobs.
 
  II. Dirty Environment 
 
  II.i. Destroy Environment 
 
 First off, the Canadian tar sands oil pits are not too damaging to the environment. Even if this was not true, my opponent forgets one thing; China.
 
 "Canada has signaled it would re-route the pipeline to the West Coast and sell oil to China, which has already invested heavily in the tar sands."[4][8]
 
 So even if we blocked it here, it would be built elsewhere, and nothing would be stopped. But if we built it here, it would help our economy.
 
 But even so, "According to Environment Canada's measurements, the oilsands has reduced its per barrel GHG output by 29% since 1990. Despite massive expansion of oilsands production in the last two decades, Canada's oil companies have managed to cut their per barrel carbon output by nearly a third."[9] So, tar sands are getting a lot cleaner.
 
 Now what is it with all these "sticky" tar sands? "Oil from tar sands is very similar to oil already transported throughout the United States. The process of refining tar sands oil is verifiable, and exploration, production, and exportation of such oil has already begun. Indeed, Canada is already America's largest supplier of oil and natural gas, and this oil can be made into many useful items like asphalt, gasoline, and jet fuel."[11] So they aren't really that bad.
 
 Now, as for global warming: "The additional emissions generated by replacing conventional oil with the crude that the pipeline could have carried would have been no more than a small fraction of 1 percent of total annual U.S. greenhouse gas pollution."[10] So, the KXL's contribution is almost negligible.
 
 And as for the Ogallala Aquifer: "The first thing you should realize is that the aquifer slopes from west to east, so only the downslope part of the aquifer would potentially be affected by a spill. Secondly, the geologic nature of the aquifer, which at its shallowest is 300 feet below the surface, would tend to confine any spill to a very small area."[12] "Any leak in the pipeline would only affect "10's or 100's of feet around the pipeline." The very structure of the aquifer as a composite collection of porous rock, sand, and sediment makes it so that oil could not permeate the general aquifer."[11] It won't affect the aquifer much.
 
 It really won't affect the environment that much.
 
  II.ii. Unstable Pipe 
 
 "While the concern over spills is something to consider, history shows that the pipeline is very safe. According to TransCanada, the pipeline owner, there have been 14 spills since 2010, most of these occurred at pumping stations rather from a ruptured pipeline. The typical spill was 5 gallons and the largest was 21,000 gallons but only 210 gallons escaped the plant."[12]
 
 "Continual electronic and manual monitoring will insure the integrity of the pipeline and the volume of oil being transported has even been lowered to 1308 psi, well under federal regulation, in order to prevent unsafe pressure levels.""The steel to be used on the new pipeline will be tested to withstand 125 percent of allowable pressure, if it cannot withstand 125 percent then it will not be used. State of the art emergency response teams will also be on stand-by for any possibilities of a leak."[12]
 
 Also, on the width of the pipe: "The new XL pipeline will use steel stronger than that used in the existing Keystone Pipeline. The steel to be used on the new pipeline will be tested to withstand 125 percent of allowable pressure, if it cannot withstand 125 percent then it will not be used. State of the art emergency response teams will also be on stand-by for any possibilities of a leak."[12]
 
 So, there really isn't that much effect on the environment.
 
  III. Higher Oil Prices 
 
 I already refuted most of this, but I will post one thing: "All the oil sent through the pipeline will be processed in American refineries. Also, it is better financially for TransCanada to sell to American markets, as it is cheaper to do so. However, if the pipeline is not built, it is far more likely that foreign nations will be eager to buy this oil."[12]
 
  Conclusion 
 
 "The oil sands have made Alberta the hottest place in Canada for jobs, investment, and growth, helping the country avoid many of the economic woes afflicting the United States and much of Europe"[13] Oil sands means lessened recession.
