TITLE: 9/11 was a false flag event

CATEGORY: Society

"Saudi Arabia being an ally since WW2 has had no clear benefit to the 911 incident considering they made literal fortunes from our relationship. Saudi Arabia holds the worlds largest reserve of crude oil and also happens to be our top provider, certainly a country that has nothing to gain by damaging U.S. relations."
 
 This is a tactic referred to in Islam as "taqiya" and maruna, and the overall foundation of their tactic is called "stealth jihad".
 
 Taqiya is to lie about your identity or loyalty to destroy your enemy from within.
 
 The Prophet of Islam, Muhammed, said, "War is deceit".

 The general construct of this philosophy is:
 
 1)Become the citizens of the nations considered non-Muslim
  
 2)Outbreed them. 
 
 3)become their influential people, such as tv personalities, politicians, etc.
 
 4)Destroy them from the inside. In this case it is:
 
 A)Break them financially.
 
 B)Put them in a state of fear
 
 C)Use political correctness and liberal politics against them. Use freedom to destroy freedom.
 
 QUOTE:
 Walid Shoebat, ex Muslim-
 
 "What the West does not understand about Islamism is that Jihad is very systematic. It has stages. If Muslims have the upper hand, then Jihad is waged by force. If Muslims do not have the upper hand, then Jihad is waged through financial and political means. Since Muslims do not have the upper hand in America or Europe, they talk about peace in front of you while supporting Hamas and Hezbollah in the back room. The whole idea of Islam being a peaceful religion emanates from that silent stage of Jihad."
 
 "Although the word Jihad standing by itself means "struggle," what Westerners need to focus on when reading the Hadith regarding Mohammed"s Jihad is similar to the focus needed when reading Mein Kampf by Adolph Hitler."

 "Demoralize the enemy from within by surprise, terror, sabotage, assassination. This is the war of the future."
 Adolf Hitler-"Mein Kampf"

 This isn't immigration. It's an invasion. 
 
 This slow, silent jihad has turned Denmark and Sweden into the rape capitals of the world. We are next.
