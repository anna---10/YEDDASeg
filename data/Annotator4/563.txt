TITLE: There is no such thing as virus

CATEGORY: Science

There is no such thing as a virus. This concept was invented at the same time as scientists started to realize that bacteria don't cause disease, so they had to find another smaller disease base. The viruse is just a fictional creation to justify the pharmaeutical industry in its quest to create a mullti-billion dollar empire of profit making. Ebola and polio are caused by pesticides and not by viruses. This is a cover-up to protect the pharmaceutical industry from litigation and blame.
