TITLE: 14 Year olds who have been convicted in adult court of 1st degree murder should be sent to adult

CATEGORY: Society

Living in adult prison as a 14 year old is a much better way to punish a murderer. They were old enough to commit this disgusting crime so they are able to spend adult time. Different people cope and react to spending time in prison in different ways. The underground violent environment that exists is not the only environment for prisoners to live in. A 2000 Texas study found that youth in adult prisons had about a 30% lower recidivism rate than those who did time in the juvenile system. Adult prison is not just a violent culture.
