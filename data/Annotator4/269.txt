TITLE: Humanity should focus on video games, while the Superior A.I. Race handles space travel.

CATEGORY: Science

Humans are bigger than that, we`re not limitated enough so that we should lock ourselves up in front of a screen like a dumb monkey. Of course we have limitations, but that never stopped us from doing way more than any other specie did so far. Also, we created A.I. exactly to serve us, they`re not superior. The planet has been just fine for 4.5 billion years without that sort of technology, it isn`t truly essential.
