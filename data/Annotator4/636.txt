TITLE: Prostitution should be legalized

CATEGORY: Society

For many years people believed prostitution to be too taboo to talk about but as of late many countries have actually been making moves to legalize prostitution and some have even completely decriminalized it.
 
 Many people are quick to talk about how dangerous of a job prostitution is and that keeping it illegal keeps people from wanting anything to do with prostitution but should it be legalized then sex workers will become much less vulnerable as the field will be more exposed to the public and regulated by the government. Also in countries that have already decriminalized prostitution many of them claim that there has been little to no increase in sex trafficking only an increase in the protection of sex workers.
 
 While the field of work involving any form of sex is not a very popular choice for those who choose to work in it those who take advantage of it or even just society looking upon it but if you really think about it prostitutes are just ever day people just trying to make a living doing something that they may or may not like and who are we to judge that.
 
 Since the job of a prostitute is such a dangerous one and is illegal at that when a prostitute winds up with a dangerous or violent customer she can't call the police and say "Hey this guy is attacking me please help" because the police will show up and realize okay there's prostitution going on here you're going to jail so prostitutes can't rely on the protection of the police.
