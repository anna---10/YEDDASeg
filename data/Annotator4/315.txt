TITLE: Lower the legal sex age

CATEGORY: Politics

I'm a pretty open-minded guy. I have nothing against people wanting to have crazy sex lives, but age 11??? What is that? 6th grade?? Kids at that age don't have the ability to gauge consequences. They can't even legally work, so child support is out the window. I can't even imagine a doctor telling some 11 year-old kid he has the clap or the HIV. This is pretty far off the deep end for me.
