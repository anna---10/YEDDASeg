TITLE: should NASA have more funds?

CATEGORY: Science

First of all, I'd like to say that my opponent made some really good points in the last round, however I'm seeing one problem with letting the private business owners compete, they're not helping advance our technologies down here, they're just going to be looking to get more cash in the coffers, (no offense.) Also, if they're making good profits, where is that cash going to go other than the workers? They're not paying any rent, (unless there's a realty business up there,) and i doubt that they'll be feeling generous and send some to earth,so the result is a BIG money pileup, (still no offense to business owners.) There is another thing I'd like to point out, I'm not saying that the big national companies like NASA should monopolize space, more like, explore it for the private businesses and see where's safe and where's not and have a mutually beneficial agreement and not let one monopolize everything.
