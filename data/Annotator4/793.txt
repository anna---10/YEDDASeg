TITLE: Tax evaders should be sent to workhouses

CATEGORY: Society

Tax evasion is a numbers game. Let's take the hypothetical example of a braying young aristocrat who has an unearned income of �100,000 per year, this money being accrued through an offshore trust fund that his over-privileged mummy and daddy set up for him when he was born.
 
 Now, let's say this indolent young nobleman resents paying the 28% capital gains tax due when repatriating the money back into the UK and decides to consult a corrupt tax accountant to see what measures he might take to jew Her Majesty's Revenue & Customs out of the money he would owe them.
 
 That accountant is likely to advise the slippery young gent to divide his trust fund income between 10 separate tax dodges, with each caper laundering �10,000 each. By doing this, if the taxman did stumble across one of these wheezes and the tax-dodging toff is duly prosecuted, as a punishment he would have to pay the tax on the �10,000: �2,800, plus a fine equivalent to that amount, so a total of �5,600.
 
 However, our upper-class fraudster would not be too bothered by this penalty because he would still be saving the tax due on the remaining �90,000 – that is �25,200 - and would, therefore, be �19,600 better off overall as the result of his portfolio of tax evasion schemes.
 
 Now, on an apparently unrelated issue, manufacturing companies in the West find it difficult to compete on cost with rival firms based in emerging economies such as India because these countries tolerate child labour, have no minimum wage and impose very few health and safety regulations on employers.
 
 The link to the two issues above is the workhouse [1]. We could punish tax evaders more effectively and help our manufacturing industry out at the same time by sending convicted tax evaders to secure workhouses run by manufacturing companies. These firms would pay the inmates �2.65 per day, equivalent to the average pay of a production worker in India {2}, and these wages would be forwarded directly to the government to pay off the offenders' fines.
 
 So, in return for providing rudimentary accommodation (a sleeping mat next to the machinery would be more than sufficient for these creative-accounting criminals) and basic meals (insipid gruels and stale bread would be more than these tax-fiddling felons deserve), the workhouse owners would have a workforce that they could pay the same as their third world competitors.
 
 Meanwhile, an important message would be sent to wealthy individuals who believe that they are entitled to benefit from the country's publicly-funded infrastructure without contributing to the cost of it and that message would be: "You are a dirty, cheating scumbag and if we catch you fiddling your taxes you will be dealt with like the lowlife criminal that you are."
 
 Tax evasion is not a victimless crime: if rich tax-evaders paid their dues we'd all benefit from better public services or pay lower taxes, or both, and that's why tax evaders should be sent to workhouses
 
 Thank you.
