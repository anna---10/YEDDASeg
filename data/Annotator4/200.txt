TITLE: Gun control

CATEGORY: Politics

To let everybody know I’m against gun control, so I’m for the right to bear arms. 
 
 
  “Good chance that the criminal won't harm anyone until the police arrive” 
 No, criminals will shoot you no matter what. They are not going to stay and wait for the police. 
 
  “Robberies would nearly cease: imagine a man trying to rob a bank with baseball bat.” 
 Once again robbers are criminals; criminals do not follow the law. 
 
 
 Now these are the point’s I’m going to debate in the next following rounds.
 
 1. What are the pros of owning guns?
 2. Second amendment.
 3. Criminals?
 4. How effective has some states have been with gun control?
 5. Comparing to other countries.
 6. No guns?
 
 Thank you for challenging me to this debate. 
 
 As this is my first round, I shall only post the attack of my opponent’s argument and the points I will be debating. I will also attack my opponent’s points and arguments along the way. 
 
 Good luck!
