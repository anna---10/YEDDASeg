TITLE: Japan is becoming a threat to the peace in East Asia

CATEGORY: Politics

"Then now he knows they don't like his visit to the shrine, but why hasn't he explained yet???"
  I am not responsible for Prime Minister Abe so I won't make any claim here. It would be better to read statements made by the Japanese government. 
 
 "Perhaps you should adknowledge that now the border disputes are over and resolved" 
 Those borders are still disputed by their respective countries internationally to this very day. Therefore the border disputes are not resolved. However, the conflicts and clashes on these borders have died down,for now.
 
  "But I dont think Japan should attack China because China has a much more stronger military force." 
 Japan would not attack China. Japan's military forces are not large enough to launch an attack on mainland China. This is why Japan is not the threat to peace in East Asia. China may attack Japan though.
 
 In conclusion, I will say my opponent has failed to address the issue of how Japan has become a threat to the peace in East Asia. Instead, he discussed historical events and Shinzo Abe's trip to the Yasakuni shrine. The only issue coming close to Japan threatening the peace in East Asia was Japan's military buildup. That however does not make Japan a threat to peace in East Asia. Even Pro admitted the Japanese military was inferior to China's. So Japan is not the threat in the current scenario taking place in East Asia. 
 
 I would like thank Pro for hosting this debate. After reading this debate you agree that Japan is not a threat to East Asia, Vote Con.
