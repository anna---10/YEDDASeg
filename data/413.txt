TITLE: Animal rights

CATEGORY: Politics

C1: animals are alive too.
 
 Living and not dead. (1)
 
 Or
 
 "1.�Living things are highly organized.
 
 2.�All living things have an ability to acquire materials and energy.
 
 3.�All living things have an ability to respond to their environment.
 
 4.�All living things have an ability to reproduce.
 
 5.�All living things have an ability to adapt." (2)
 
 Now based on this an animal is alive. Living things deserve rights. Just an opinion.
 
 C2: Animals feel pain too
 
 "Behaviour
 Other animals show reflex responses similar to our own. For example, when we accidentally touch a hot iron we respond almost immediately by retracting our hand. There is a lag period following this when no adverse sensations are felt but, if left untreated, the burn begins to throb and we alter our behaviour to guard the affected area." (3)
 
 Now this means their mistreatment I'd cruel as they feel abuse.
 
 Sub point: feel emotional pain
 
 " research has provided evidence that monkeys, dogs, cats and birds can show signs of emotional pain and display behaviours associated with depression during painful experience, i.e. lack of motivation, lethargy, anorexia, unresponsiveness to other animals."
 
 This makes the problem worse, it hurts them in the brain too. So if they have no rights then it would be a cruel world for them.
 
 C3: All life is sacred
 
 Life, no matter animal or human, is worth something. (4) These creatures are worth just as much as any life. (4)
 
 Moses, I am gonna go easy as it is your first time, hence the short response. Good luck.
