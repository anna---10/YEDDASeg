TITLE: Fascism was worse then Communism

CATEGORY: Politics

Some say that Fascism was worse then Communism. I say no to that! Both systems of government are bad and have cause millions to die but I believe that Communism was worse the Fascism on the bases that Fascism was a least a little flexible with religion, Communism lasted longer then Fascism did, Communist governments killed more people then any Fascist government, and finally Fascism never had the power to destroy the world like the Communist government of the USSR did with their nuclear weapons.
 
 Now I want for someone to debate with me on this topic.
