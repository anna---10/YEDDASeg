TITLE: Should We Re-Evaluate/Reallocate Aid Given to Pakistan?

CATEGORY: Politics
<<<outside of argumentation>>>
I thank my opponent for a great debate and wish him or her luck in future.
 
 To begin, I will be going over (1) what's happened, (2) why my contentions still matter, (3) why my opponent's contentions don't, and (4) some issues and impacts in this round.
 
  1. What's Happened?
 
  Round 1:
 CON: 
 (A) "Allies will immediately become wary" = "Connections shaky with everyone else"
 PRO: 
 (A) Terrorism is not a real threat to the United States. (B) Messed-up on Afghanistan Argument
 
 Round 2:
 CON: 
 (A) "Puts Pakistan in danger"/"Leaving them without the money" 
 (REF) Pakistan, not Afghanistan
 PRO: 
 (REF) (a) Allies: No harm to our hegemony. (b) Pakistan: Al Qaeda, No need, No want, Already helped. 
 (O) Aid is not defined.
 (RES) Terrorism is still not a real threat. 
 
 Round 3: 
 CON:
 (A) They need help. (B) Result with reconsideration of relationship
 PRO:
 Well, here we are folks. 
  
  2. PRO's Contentions
 
<<<aspect1>>>
  1. Terrorism, specifically of the nuclear variety, is not a real threat to the United States anymore.
   The claim is very broad and does not only apply to Afghanistan, but the entire Middle East, including specific parts on Pakistan. If you were to look at any of my evidence from the first point, you can see that it remains broad in reference to the Middle East as they are ideas that expand over the entire region. You can keep this point in the round because you will be seeing that we won't be accomplishing any of Pakistan's problems by continuing the funding. Even more than this, you can look to logic. With a modern, technological world, we can see that nuclear safety is of the greatest importance which is why the IAEA is continuing to secure all nuclear facilities. Nuclear terrorism is not a problem in Pakistan. We cannot fund something that is not a problem.

  2. We have not failed to democratize Afghanistan, therefore not causing harms to our national security.
   You can drop this point. I gladly will allow you to do such. Sorry for referencing to Afghanistan.  
 (Copied and pasted because there was no refutation against it.)
 
 Main Point: The IMPACTS
 
<<<aspect2>>>
If we are funding something that is not a problem, we will have economic impacts as well as societal impacts.
 
<<<outside of argumentation>>>
Economic: Wasting Money
 Societal: Loss of Lives / Further Disparities in Wealth
 
  3. CON's Contentions
  My responses to CON's Contentions barely go refuted. My opponent tries to turn my response in his last speech, but he fails to do so.
 He explains that,
 
 " Yes, Pakistan is home to Al Qaeda. But that's my next point- they clearly still need help! We solved one problem there (securing the weapons) but breaking a promise and abandoning them in their time of need should never be acceptable!"
 
 
<<<aspect3>>>
 The flaw with this response is that NUCLEAR WEAPONS is the biggest problem in the region. Since we have secured that problem, we do have more security, and can cut back on our aid. To continue funding is to  continue funding Al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and the Haqqani network.
  
<<<outside of argumentation>>>
 But, even if you don't want to look to that, you can look to my other three responses to his "Pakistan needs help" arguments.
 I will gladly repost them down here for reference.
 
  (2) 
<<<aspect4>>>
  Pakistan's nuclear security does not need support from the United States  . According to Malou Innocent of the CATO Institute, "Given the number of physical security measures in place, the army's robust command and control operations, and Islamabad's commitment to having a nuclear deterrent vis-a-vis India, Pakistan's nuclear arsenal appears to be relatively safe, at least for the time being. Gradual, covert transfer of nuclear secrets, rather than a sudden and dramatic proliferation, is the more likely danger -- and the one policymakers should watch for. Finally, the scenario of citizens electing radical Islamist parties that might be tempted to give nuclear technology or materials to terrorist groups remains unlikely for the foreseeable future." 
 
  (3) 
<<<aspect5>>>
  Pakistan does not want assistance.   According to Paul Kerr of the Congressional Research Service, "More recently, a Pakistan Foreign Office spokesperson, responding to a report detailing alleged U.S.-Pakistani discussions regarding contingency plans for U.S. forces to help secure Islamabad’s nuclear weapons, stated November 8, 2009, that Pakistan 'does not require any foreign assistance in this regard.' Pakistan will never 'allow any country to have direct or indirect access to its nuclear and strategic facilities,' the spokesperson said, adding that, 'no talks have ever taken place on the issue of the security of Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal with US officials'" 
 
  (4) 
<<<aspect6>>>
   America has already helped Pakistan to secure its weapons in the past.    According to Mehlaqa Samdani from the Center for Strategic and International Studies, "an agreement of sorts had taken place between Pakistani and American military officials whereby ‘specially trained American units provided added security for the Pakistani arsenal in case of a crisis. Pakistan is training 8,000 additional people to protect the country's nuclear arsenal."

 Furthermore, he drops his own contention about allies in the 2nd round. He doesn't refute against my response to it (below). The biggest impact that he is trying to get is the loss of hegemony (I'm assuming), however he cannot gain access to this because it simply doesn't happen. Hegemony is not affected.
  
   "Considering that allies lead to hegemony and influence, I will weigh them as such. However, the flaw with this argument is that it simply untrue. Any and all policies in the Middle East have not led to a loss of hegemony and influence. America will keep its hegemonic power, regardless of relations. No other country has the ability to become the new hegemonic power. According to Noam Chomsky, "The possible hegemons are poor countries with severe internal problems. The world is surely becoming more diverse, but despite America's decline, in the foreseeable future there is no competitor for global hegemonic power" While opposers might comment, saying "BUT CHINA?!" There is a simple response, courtesy of Daniel W. Drezner, "The widespread misperception that China is catching up to the United States stems from a number of analytical flaws, the most common of which is the tendency to draw conclusions about the U.S.-China power balance from data that compare China only to its former self. For example, many studies note that the growth rates of China’s per capita income, value added in high technology industries, and military spending exceed those of the United States and then conclude that China is catching up. This focus on growth rates, however, obscures China’s decline relative to the United States in all of these categories. China’s growth rates are high because its starting point was low. China is rising, but it is not catching up" Therefore, you can drop my opponent's entire argument on allies because not only does he not give sufficient evidence or backing for his claim, but because it is also simply wrong."

  4. Issues and Impacts
 
  1. My opponent does not refute any of my contentions adequately.
 2. My opponent did not provide any backing or evidence for his claims.
 3. I refuted most of his claims, with evidence and logical backing.
 4. I was left with my 1 contention and responses at the end of the round, while my opponent was not.
 
 1. Impact: Lives
 I will be winning this debate on "Who will be saving the more lives?". If we were to reallocate our funding, we would be able to work on our own domestic problems because we have dealt with the foreign nuclear security threats (which could potentially take more lives).
 
 2. Impact: Economy
 I will be winning this debate on "Who will be saving the most money?". I think this is pretty self-explanatory. If we were to reallocate our funding, we could work on our own domestic problems, having dealt with foreign threats.
 
  5. Conclusion
 
<<<conclusion>>>
 When looking at the resolution, we need to understand that not all aid will be cut. Only some will be reallocated. We won't be ending ALL aid to Pakistan. We see that we will be saving a profit and be able to save lives in the long run
 Thank you,
