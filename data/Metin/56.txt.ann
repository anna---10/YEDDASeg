TITLE: Should gay marriage be legal (not is it right)?

CATEGORY: Politics
<<<outside of argumentation>>>
Thanks very much my opponent for your personal opinions which are not fact and therefore cannot be relied upon as you fail to back it up with concrete evidence but rather saying something completely unintelligible. However, I want to start by defining certain words on your debate topic.
 
 gay marriage
 noun
 marriage between partners of the same sex
 (as recognized in some jurisdictions).
 
 Legal means permitted by law.
 
 right
 adjective
 Morally good, justified, or acceptable.
 
 "I am arguing the legalization and not
 whether or not it is right. I think that
 gay marriage should be legal because
 It does not affect you if you are not
 gay. Just because gay marriage is
 legal docent mean that the government is going
 to force you to divorce your spouse and get
 married to your same sex. If you are worried
 about God's approval than don't get married to
 someone of the same sex. If someone on tv gets
 married and you see it you are not going to hell."
 
 The above statement have so many grammatical and spelling errors which have expose my opponent's inability to spell and write well and above all it is base on what he thinks and not what is generally true(fact).
 
 To start with,my opponent's opinion "that
 gay marriage should be legal because
 It does not affect you if you are not
 gay. " is completely false as it affect the whole society whether you are Gay or not. According to one research done by:
 
 Yale Child Study Center psychiatrist Kyle
 Pruett reports that children of IVF often ask
 their single or lesbian mothers about their
 fathers, asking their mothers questions like
 the following:"Mommy, what did you do with
 my daddy?" "Can I write him a letter?" "Has
 he ever seen me?" "Didn't you like him?
 Didn't he like me?"
 
<<<aspect1>>>
 from this research one sees that children are one of the people of society who are mostly affected as they either not stay with their biological Mother or Father as the case may be and may even be victims of assault or maltreatment as that concrete love is completely absent because their biological parent(s) are not present.
 
<<<aspect2>>>
 "Just because gay marriage is
 legal docent mean that the government is going
 to force you to divorce your spouse and get
 married to your same sex."
 This statement has grammatical as well as spelling error but I will manage it anyway. Yes of course this is true, the government will not force you to leave your spouse but the legalization of same sex "marriage" will devalue traditional marriage,public morality, and also it will risks so many children to not staying with their biological parents(Mother and Father).
 
<<<outside of argumentation>>>
 "If you are worried
 about God's approval than don't get married to
 someone of the same sex. If someone on tv gets
 married and you see it you are not going to hell."
 
 I want you to start taking English classes because your grammar is so poor and unintelligible. Of course God will never approve something as immoral as same-sex "marriage" as it is against his plans not only for humans but for all other Animals. As we read in the Book of Genesis: "God created man in His
 image; in the Divine image he created him; male
 and female He created them. God blessed them,
 saying: "Be fertile and multiply; fill the earth and
 subdue it."" (Gen. 1:28-29)
 The same was taught by Our Savior Jesus
 Christ: "From the beginning of the creation, God
 made them male and female. For this cause a
 man shall leave his father and mother; and shall
 cleave to his wife." (Mark 10:6-7).
 
 Also your argument that "If you are worried
 about God's approval than don't get married to
 someone of the same sex. If someone on tv gets
 married and you see it you are not going to hell." is completely wrong. Just has the old adage says"The righteous suffers together with the wicked." We see that it is also evident in the Bible which most non-religious people will not believe but that does not makes it wrong, The destruction of "Sodom and Gomorrah" for Homosexuality is a clear example even though not all of them were homosexuals.
 (Gen.19:24-25)
 "The Lord rained down sulphurous fire upon Sodom
 and Gomorrah. He overthrew those cities and the
 whole Plain, together with the inhabitants of the
 cities and the produce of the soil."
 from the above quotation one see that a whole city or society can be destroy whether you watch it on Television or not as long as you do not try and fight against it(same-sex "marriage")
 
 To crown it all, the issue of smoking marijuana and drinking alcohol in certain place and at certain age is a "straw man" as that is completely out of the subject of argument which is whether Gay marriage should be legal. I am looking forward to a good debate so please try to spell and write good English and do not argue based on what you think but base on fact. Good luck.
