When asked directly for a " reason to re  ject either Roe V Wade or the 14th Constitutional Amendment, " none has been provided. I have even offered to include any closing remarks from pro in with my own.
 
<<<conclusion>>>
  Closing Remarks :
 My case was not actually in favor of abortion being a good thing, yet it remains a necessary option for many women, for a host of reasons men will never have. As men lack the ability to understand what the woman is going through, it should not fall to men to declare what a woman is or is not allowed to do to her body (notice the lack of changes in the male body during pregnancy, and men having never had to write their wills once pregnancy was discovered).
