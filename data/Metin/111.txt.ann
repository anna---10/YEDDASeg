TITLE: Domestic Corporal Punishment is Always Immoral

CATEGORY: Society
<<<outside of argumentation>>>
Pro simply didn't understand the Bible verse I provided. The Bible verse I did provide *encouraged* spanking. It didn't condone it. Again, the scripture stated "   "Don't fail to correct your children. They won't die if you spank them. Physical discipline may well save them from death"      ( Proverbs 23:13-14 , NLT).   Obviously as you can see, Pro is the one who misunderstood my scripture, because my scripture actually advocates DCP.    My opponent states  "spanking does not teach what is right. It only teaches that this particular act was wrong. Knowing what is wrong is not the same as knowing what is right". 
<<<aspect1>>>
 This is false. When a child commits wrong, they are generally told why are going to be disciplined, and that they should not repeat their poor decisions. Then comes the discipline, and this helps the child make better decisions because they don't want to be disciplined again. It also teaches children discipline.

  My opponent seems *again* to think that DCP is merely beating a child. This is again, false. If DCP was in fact immoral, government would band spanking, but it isn't banned.

     http://www.youtube.com...     Again, we can distinguish the difference between the word "beat" and "discipline"     --Beat- strike (a person or an animal) repeatedly and violently so as to hurt or injure them, usually with an implement such as a club or whip      --Discipline- control that is gained by requiring that rules or orders be obeyed and punishing bad behavior.            There is a major difference between these two definitions. I would like my opponent to explain how slapping a child's hand is considered beating. Again, my opponent keeps linking DCP to "beating children" and this is not the case. If it was, all parents who have spanked their children, or disciplined them would be put in jail and charged with child abuse, but that isn't the case at all.  
  
   Pro states "I ask my opponent to explain how this is nonsensical. What I see as nonsensical is hitting your child as a punishment for hitting his sister and expecting the boy to stop hitting people. Children look up to their parents; they are their role models. So it is to be expected that children will adopt similar behaviors from them, such as using violence as a way of sorting out problems." 
<<<aspect2>>>
    Nonsensical meaning statements have little, or no value. My sources that I have provided in the 2nd round, go to show that spanking your children causes violence is in fact, a myth. So, the statement about spanking resulting in anger later on in life is a myth. 
  
  
  
<<<aspect3>>>
  
  Pro then states "I ask my opponent to explain why there must be pain in order for children to learn good decision making. Why must a child physically suffer? If parents set boundaries for their children and gradually teach them about making wise choices, the notion of empathy, and the Golden Rule, the child will likely gain a stronger understanding of right and wrong. Pain and fear is not necessary and should not be used to discipline children."    First off, it's unreasonable, and not fair to say that parents make their children "suffer" if they discipline their own children. 
<<<outside of argumentation>>>
Lets define "suffer"       Suffer- : to experience pain, illness, or injury      :   to experience something unpleasant (such as defeat, loss, or damage)         I would like to ask my opponent: if your parents had spanked you as a child, do you accuse them of abusing you? Should they be put in jail? Do your parents hate you? Or did they do it out of love?          Lets note, my opponent seems to think that all parents who commit DCP actively abuse their children, which i have proven many times is not true
