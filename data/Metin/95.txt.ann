TITLE: The gay people are NOT trying to take over the world.

CATEGORY: Society
<<<outside of argumentation>>>
I accept, and I will be defending the idea that gay people are attempting to take over the world.
 
<<<aspect1>>>
 First, I observe that there is a fundamental difference between taking control of a system and revolting against the system as a means to take control - my argument will say that gay people are attempting to take control by democratic or legal avennues, NOT that they are taking control via revolution or a militant means.
