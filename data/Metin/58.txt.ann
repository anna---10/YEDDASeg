TITLE: Infanticide should be encouraged up to the age of 3

CATEGORY: Society
<<<aspect1>>>
First I will start out with a semantic argument. Yraelz stated, "Infanticide should be encouraged in all situations. Infants should not have the rights until 3 years of age." Now, if infanticide was to be encouraged in ALL situations, the human population, including his own prospective progeny, would go extinct. Perhaps he meant it as a bit of hyperbole, but regardless, the idea is asinine, sick, and convoluted.

 "The infant thereby is a by product of the pleasure principle. In other words an infant is the exact same as any other animal at this time of development. It does not engage in critical thought, it does not engage in anything outside of what it wants."
 
 Supposing that your assertion was accurate, you would like to kill them because of it? As much as I would prefer not to belabor the obvious, it needs to be done here: Humans, pretty much all of them, regardless of age, are self-serving. In fact it usually takes some effort to not be constantly thinking about your own wants and desires, which is precisely what makes it so refreshing when somebody does do something thoughtful for someone else. I don't even need to know you personally in order to know that you have selfish tendencies that extend for beyond your philanthropic tendencies. But we don't want to kill you because of that.
 
 You spoke about "critical thought," and how infants lack it. I'm curious to know what constitutes critical thought in your opinion? Obviously you think that infants are incapable of it, and I'd be very curious to hear what it is and why they lack it, as if it somehow justifies murder.
 
<<<aspect2>>>
 There are some adults well past the minimum age of legal adulthood who never achieve an intellect past that of a small child. There are those who are profoundly mentally retarded. Does their age spare them euthanisation under your proposal, or is it the fact that they are, I can only guess, stupid, that you would like to kill them?
 
<<<outside of argumentation>>>
 "Infanticide should be encouraged to the same level that killing any other animal is societally accepted."
 
<<<aspect3>>>
 The societally accepted reasons for killing animals is primarily for human consumption. We hunt animals. We breed animals to later be slaughtered for their meat. Should we do the same for infants? Are we supposed to engage in cannibalism on top of murdering them for apparently no good reason? Because I can't understand why you would WANT to murder infants in the first place, that we should be encouraging it, other than the fact that you equivocate their intelligence to that of animals. This makes no sense to me, and I am confident that most of the readers will be profoundly disturbed by your rationale.
 
<<<outside of argumentation>>>
 I have two children of my own -- a 9 year old girl, and a 4 year old boy. Although my son has now apparently, and thankfully, reached the age of non-muderdom in your opinion, I remember quite vividly what he was like only one year ago. I can assure you that he was quite capable of feeling all the emotions that you and I have been bestowed. In fact, all infants are capable of that.
 
 I sometimes meet young people who are themselves the very epitome of selfishness, and who make similar arguments as you are making. This is partly due to the fact that they themselves are young, inexperienced, and naive. It is difficult for them, as they transition between teenage a**hole to adulthood, to fully appreciate the more beautiful things in life -- such as the joy of childhood, and the joy a parent receives from watching their children growing and learning. For whatever specific reason, this is lost on many in the younger generation who swallow -- hook, line, and sinker -- these sadistic and unemotionally detached notions.
 
 And just in case you forgot, there were other people who made similar arguments with you and justified them in the same way -- Nazi Germany.
 
 In case you have forgotten what an infant looks like and acts like, perhaps you need to take another look at what you are actually suggesting.
 
 This is apparently what you'd like to massacre because you think.... they're stupid and selfish.
