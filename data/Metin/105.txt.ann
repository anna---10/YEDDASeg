TITLE: Someone Should Create a Separate Nation For People of "Alternate Sexualities"

CATEGORY: Society
<<<outside of argumentation>>>
"Let's start with the location, Alaska. You say it's really close to Russia but is it? Most people in Russia live in the far west. You would have to travel all the way over Siberia to reach it, which is approximately 13 million square kilometers. About half the world."
 What are planes for?
 
 "So you send all of them over there, what about people in Alaska? Will they just get sent away? Or will they just have to accept pedophiles and necrophiles in their community? That sounds very unfair to me."
 
<<<aspect1>>>
 Well, there's very few people in that huge strip of land. The state of Rhode Island has more people than Alaska does, and that's saying a lot! The Alaskan denizens could easily be relocated to two or three cities, and the LGBT nation could have all the rest.

 "Not to mention that the most alternate people would come from Africa and the Middle East. How will they adjust to the climate? They can get sick and cold, they might even freeze to death. That sounds pretty ironic considering it's the "humane thing to do."
 
<<<aspect2>>>
 They can adjust. Don't forget that Europeans (a peoples from a cold climate) went to Africa (a very hot place). Granted, Africa was called "White Man's Grave" because of this, but today we have heaters and stuff like that which could prevent this from happening.

 "So let's pretend all the inhabitants are magically fine with it, and let's pretend the extreme cold isn't a problem. Then they'll have to build a society."
 
 Dude, I'm not suggesting they start from scratch! There'd be houses, towns, heaters, air conditioners etc. These basics would be provided as donations by several governments.
 
 "I imagine that will be very hard considering nobody can start families because there are no straight men and women."
 
 Correct, but there will always be new arrivals.
 
 "There will be no biological children, and in the very rare case that there are, they will be constantly threatened by pedophiles walking around."
 
 What's the matter, feeling Pedophobic? It's just an alternate lifestyle, right? They're born that way, right?
 
 "Okay, so let's ignore that problem as well. So they alternate people have built a community and they're tired of eating all the reindeer and crab legs. They want some potatoes and rice. How will they get that? Do they have money? What's their currency? The American dollar? I doubt the evil conservatives would want to fund a state completely made up by alternate sexualities."
 
<<<aspect3>>>
 Ignoring your Conservaphobic remark, Alaska has tons of oil. The LGBT people would make their living pumping the stuff out of the ground and exporting it all around the world. With the money they'd make they could import whatever food they want.
 Plus, I'm sure that even in Alaska there's some kind of crop or edible substance which can be grown.

 I'm looking forward to my opponent's rebuttal.
