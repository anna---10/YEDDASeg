TITLE: Resolved: Abortion should stay legal in the U.S.

CATEGORY: Politics
<<<outside of argumentation>>>
Contention 1: personhood.
 I'll start with defining person- a human being, whether man, woman, or child:  http://dictionary.reference.com... 
 
<<<aspect1>>>
So when my opponet states that you have to be a person to have the right to live well my friends I have defined person and the fetus is included. Then my opponet goes on to say it must communicate and I believe all mothers on this site will tell you a fetus will let you know what they like to eat and when they're hungry.

Contention 1.5: Religon
 Here our some verse from the Bible that are against abortion.
 Romans 12:1
 Therefore, I urge you, brothers, in view of God's mercy, to offer your bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God-this is your spiritual act of worship.
 
 John 10:10
 The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.
 
 Acts 18:10
 For I am with you, and no one is going to attack and harm you, because I have many people in this city."
 
 Ephesians 2:8
 For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith-and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God
 
<<<aspect2>>>
 Contention 2: Ownership
 No the fetus isn't entitled to a women's bird it's just sort of renting it for 9 months. To say it doesn't have the right to their mother's body is crazy, because the fetus doesn't stay there for a life time or longer. Who knows that fetus could be the next president or even the person who cures AIDS, but you wouldn't know, because you killed them.

 Contention 2.5: Health
 Abortion causes post abortion stress that might lead to suiside.  http://postabortionsyndrome.org... ......,
 Wade V. Boggs upheld and prooved abortion should be illegal
 abortion raises cancer by 130% after an abortion now I'm sure women don't want breast cancer if I'm wrong please tell me  http://www.deveber.org... ......

<<<aspect4>>>
 Contention 3. Overpopulation
 (can't see you 1st pic)
 The world isn't overpopulated, as a matter of fact the whole world's population can fit into Texas. (if they're given the same living space as New York City) "Did you know"everyone on the planet (7 billion) could fit in the state of Texas (area of 268,820 square miles) at a density 26,040 people per sq. mile. Thats a 1000 less people per square mile than in New York City!" So with my fact here from this year a month ago this outways my opponets whole 3rd contention.  http://guerillatics.com...
