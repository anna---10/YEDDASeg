TITLE: Solving the Gay Marriage Issue on a way that everyone can agree

CATEGORY: Politics
<<<outside of argumentation>>>
I would like to start this round by apologizing for saying the word "whites" instead of "strait." I have aboslutely no idea where that come from.
 
 I will now start my rebuttal.
 
 "You have already labeled my word "Garried" derogatory, when I was very clear that it was intended as a place holder; is there something wrong with calling a union between a man and a woman different from a union between two men or two women?"
 
 I was merely making the point that this an extremely derogatory term when it comes to dealing with the marriage of two homosexual people. That is all. As far as your second point, I do believe that I clearly put forth a statment of fact refuting that fact in my last argument, namely that it violates the Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. the Board of Education, when the Supreme Court ruled that separate is inherently unequal, which is exactly what you are proposing against them.
 
 "The very question is necessary to understand the fabric of the person before you, yet requires an extra question about sexuality that I really don't care to ask."
 
<<<aspect1>>>
 The point that I am making is that it should not matter whether they are gay or strait. Whether that particular person is married to a person of the same, or opposite sex should make absolutely no difference whatsoever. It is a learned habit that makes people think the way that they do about gay people that can change, but the laws have to change first.
 
<<<aspect2>>>
 A good example of this is the dying out of racism in the United States. Compared to 50 years ago, there are markedly less racists in the United States today. The same can and will be the case should gay marriage be legalized throughout the nation.

 "Gays have all of the rights that straights do."
 
 This is an absolute and unequivocal lie. It has been well documented that gays do not have the same rights as straits. On the news the other day, they had a special about how a number of Fortune 500 companies have a "Don't ask, Don't Tell" policy regarding homosexuals in the company.

 In addition to this, there are gay couples who have been in Civil Unions for as much as 20 years, but should one of them die, the other, in most cases, is left with no financial support, even after their grievous loss. Here is a story of a gay couple, which I think you'll find quite disturbing.

 In closing, I have addressed all of your arguments and look forward to your response!
