TITLE: Clinton would have been a better president than Donald Trump

CATEGORY: Politics
<<<aspect1>>>
I disagree massively to that statement. Hillary Clinton is no better than trump. You might be worrying about trump at control of any wars that might happen but may I add Clinton has no better control on war. If I have my information correct, and please correct me if I am wrong, clinton has played a role in the Syrian war being as bad as it is.
 
<<<outside of argumentation>>>
 I would have voted trump over Clinton even though I do openly despise both of them and if there was another presidential elective I would have voted for them but as Trump is a lesser of two evils, in my opinion, if I had to vote I would have voted for him.
 
 In a their 'debates' they merely were fighting more than trying to achieve a political viewpoint. This had greatly influenced my view on this matter. I disagree with Trump's idea to build a wall around the Mexican border but if he can't get planning permission to build a wall around a golf course over here in Ireland I don't see how he can manage to build a wall around the border, that is just irrational. If he's going to do anything at least either get the wall built here or get rid of the idea and prevent all the headache with the protesters.
