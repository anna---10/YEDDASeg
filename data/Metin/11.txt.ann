TITLE: Time travel is possible

CATEGORY: Science
<<<outside of argumentation>>>
Good luck to you sir!
 
 Before we start we have to ask ourselves, what is time travel? Time travel is the action of traveling between past and future, according to  http://dictionary.reference.com... 
 
 Simple enough. I will attempt to prove that this action is possible, and in fact takes place on a daily basis.
 
 1. Time dilation:
 Einstein's general theory of relativity showed that gravity and acceleration affect time. An object that's accelerating will experience time going slower, than an object at rest. Similarly, an object that's exposed to gravity will experience time going slower, then an object away from gravity. In fact, satellites in space have to account for this phenomenon. The clocks on satellites have to be adjusted, in order for the time to stay synchronized with the clocks on earth. (1)(2)
 
<<<aspect1>>>
 Here, I will try and explain why time dilation occurs. Imagine two people shine a laser pointer at the same time, from the same place, and one of these people is in a moving car. Who's laser pointer would go faster? Neither. The lasers would travel at the same speed, because you cannot travel faster than the speed of light. To make up for this, the person in the speeding car (and his laser pointer) are experiencing time more slowly. Remember these are not my words, they are the words of Albert Einstein.
 
<<<aspect1>>>
 If you drive a car, you have experienced this effect. Every time you accelerate, you experience this effect. If you go to the top of a building (less gravity), you experience time dilation. I have demonstrated that time travel is not only possible, but actually occurs to all of us every day. Admittedly, the effect of time dilation us humans experience is small, but it is by definition time travel. One could argue that in the future, when super fast speeds are possible, we could take advantage of this phenomenon, and use it to literally time travel.
 
<<<outside of argumentation>>>
 There are other more theoretical means of time travel. So far this is limited to sub atomic particles, worm holes, and spinning black holes. For the sake of simplicity however, I'll ignore these topics for now.
