TITLE: Social Security is a Ponzi scheme

CATEGORY: Politics
<<<outside of argumentation>>>
Ladies and Gentlemen, I take deep offence to the fact that my opponent is accusing me of supposedly straw manning my arguments. I have done none of the kind and I have responded to all of my opponent's arguments. Apparently, he did not want to rebut them all and just picked a few which he thought he could defeat. I would like to point out that my opponent is much more guilty of straw manning than me (I haven't), especially in this round where he has not rebutted anything presented.
 
 
  1. Transfer payment of Social Security
 
 
<<<aspect1>>>
 My opponent's case is simply that a government is not restrained my monetary constraints and therefore can spend ad infitum. As a result, there is no transfer of payments between generations because the government is using "new money." 
 
<<<outside of argumentation>>>
  Here is what SSO Gov has to say about the transfer of money(1)
 
 
<<<aspect2>>>
   "   Dependent upon an unsustainable progression, a common financial arrangement is the so-called "pay-as-you-go" system. Some private pension systems, as well as Social Security, have used this design. A pay-as-you-go system can be visualized as a pipeline, with money from current contributors coming in the front end and money to current beneficiaries paid out the back end.
