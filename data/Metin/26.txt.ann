TITLE: Requiring photo ID in order to vote.

CATEGORY: Politics
<<<aspect1>>>
To require photo ID for voters would be against our supposed democratic system. Unless a special voter ID is issued for free to everyone, than people will be taken out of the democratic process, namely elderly people who do not have a license or urbanites that do not own a car but use a subway or some other form of public transportation (mostly democrats might I add). I will also show that there is no "problem" with voter fraud as its proponents suggest and all evidence to support such a claim are anecdotal and fail to show nay trends. So con is to argue
 
 1. There is a voter fraud problem
 2. Having photo ID (other than one issued by the government specifically for voting) would outweigh the cost of excluding certain members of our democracy if there is any cost at all.
