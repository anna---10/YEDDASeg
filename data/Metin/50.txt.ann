TITLE: The Wage Gap Is due to discrimination

CATEGORY: Politics
<<<aspect1>>>
I contend that the gender wage gap exists not due to discrimination, but because men work more hours, take different positions, and other factors that would account into this debate.
 
<<<aspect1>>>
 Contention 1: Women work less than men
 I believe that female full-time workers on average make less money because Women work less hours than man.
 
<<<aspect1>>>
 On average, Men work 8.1 hours per day
 On average, Women work 7.3 hours per day

<<<aspect2>>>
 Contention 2: Women have babies (This one should be obvious)
 Some women decide to take time off to have a child, this takes them out of the workforce for 1-2yrs, truly depends on the woman's choice.
 On Average, 43% of Women with children leave their jobs.

 Contention 3: The Actual calculation
 The Actual calculation (Where it comes down to 72 cents on the dollar, or any other BS) is taken from the TOTAL earnings from Full-Time Male and Female workers, it does not take into account the following factors
 (Women choose different jobs, take time off from work for different reasons, work fewer hours, and make different life decisions on average. )
 
<<<outside of argumentation>>>
 As my good friend "Shoe0nHead" said, "The Wage Gap is simply the average earnings of men and women working full-time, it does not take into account different job positions, hours worked, or different jobs, it has nothing to do with the same job, it has nothing to do with discrimination *THROWS IT DESPERATELY AT THE GROUND*)
