TITLE: Abortion is wrong

CATEGORY: Society

In conclusion, a woman has a natural right to abort a non-viable fetus if she does not want to carry it to term for personal emotional reasons, e.g., she cannot handle the discomfort; she believes it will ruin her life and be a serious financial difficulty. She beliefs that she will not be a fit mother. There are many reasons. But, it is her body, and no one has the right to tell her what she has to do. Again, as long as the abortion is legal, it is her right.
