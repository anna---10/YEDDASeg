TITLE: Crimes Should Have Victims

CATEGORY: Society

Just to make everything clear with this subject, I'll list a few definitions:
 
  Victim:  a person harmed, injured, or killed as a result of a crime, accident, or other event or action.   Crime:   an action that constitutes an offense that may be prosecuted by the state and is punishable by law. 
 
 I personally believe that in order for anything to be "illegal", it should have a victim. For example, murder obviously has a victim. So anybody that commits murder should be punished, or at least kept from doing it again. Rape, theft, assault, all of these crimes have victims, and I believe that it isn't hard at all to see that things like that should be illegal.  I think that the biggest or most prominent issue that comes up when someone says "victimless crime" is drug-use. Just to name a specific example, lets talk about marijuana. When used safely, responsibly, and under the right circumstances, there is no victim. Nobody is truly "hurt". You may argue that the user is "harming" themselves, but that should be their own choice to make. If you actively decide to do something, and you feel like the pros outweigh the cons, and nobody else is "hurt" in the process, why should anyone stop you? Who could possibly believe that they should have more power over your own body than you yourself do?
