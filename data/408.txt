TITLE: Unused food not sold by supermarkets should be donated and/or recycled, not simply thrown away (2)

CATEGORY: Economics

Claim:
 
 A lot of food that we waste as a country goes unnoticed, but numbers do not lie.
 
 Warrant:
 
 In 2010, an estimated 133 billion pounds of food from U.S. retail food stores, restaurants, and homes"valued at approximately $161 billion"went uneaten. (a statistic provided by the USDA Office of the Chief Economist).
 
 Grounds:
 
 In addition, 7.4 percent (9.4 million) of U.S. households had low food security in 2016.
 What is low food security? "These food-insecure households obtained enough food to avoid substantially disrupting their eating patterns or reducing food intake by using a variety of coping strategies, such as eating less varied diets, participating in Federal food assistance programs, or getting emergency food from community food pantries (USDA Economic Research Service).
 Furthermore, 4.9 percent (6.1 million) of U.S. households had very low food security at some time during 2016.
 What is very low food security? "In these food-insecure households, normal eating patterns of one or more household members were disrupted and food intake was reduced at times during the year because they had insufficient money or other resources for food (USDA Economic Research Service).
 
 If we were to donate the food wasted in supermarkets to provide for these low food security families, we could lower these numbers and provide a system both beneficial to decreasing supermarket waste and increasing food security in the U.S..
