TITLE: Should the United States have stricter immigration laws.

CATEGORY: Politics

In my opinion, I don't think immigrants are the reason  many Americans losing jobs, but another factor (I don't expect Pro to rebute this, its jusy my opinion._
 
 
   Money concentration    :  
 
 It has been repeatedly stated in recent years that the income inequality in the United States is the biggest it has been in a long time, the wealthy are getting wealthier and the poor are getting poorer. Corporations are more rapidly and aggressively buying up and swallowing small businesses, smashing struggling   startups, and using their economic might to restrict new contenders fro  m gaining a foothold in various industries through patents and so on.  Companies are becoming greedy for profit, and are offering jobs at a very low price. When this happens, immigrants are the first ones to go, because they are more willing to work at lower prices. This isn't nessescariliy the immigrants fault, but the large corporations who need a labor force for cheap.  
 
 
 
 
 Now to address your opinion, I do partially agree that people who enter this country should be required to speak English. However, I support taking another approach, such as providing them tuitions to learn the language so they can enter here without hardship in the future.
 
 
 Like I said before, what we must to do to prevent illegal immigrants is investing in stronger border patrol and keeping future aliens from entering. There are some illegals who have been living in this country for a long time, and have contributed alot to the economy. I think just making immigration tougher wil just discourage immigrants from coming at all here.
 
 
 And thank you for this debate.
