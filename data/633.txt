TITLE: Gay Marijuana should be Legealized

CATEGORY: Politics

Cannibis is a plant which is used for its medical and recreational uses. The female species contains the buds with the drug THC is the one which produces europhic effects also known to smokers as a "high". The male species or the pollinated species produces a reduced effect which can still be smoked but it is much less effective
 Having a homosexual breed of cannibis would mean that one of the species is a hermaphrodite and the other is a female, the pollination result for this breeding occurrence is 25% the potency because of genetic matching. This is both inefficient and result from bad practice resulting from amateur growers with much more negative health effects detrimental to society.
