TITLE: The US should not ban guns.

CATEGORY: Politics

Thank you for the argument, revleader5. I have read some of your posts here, agree with most of them.
 
 Here it goes:
 
 "Also, if the military turns on us too, there is a United Nations Army always on call, ready to rapidly be deployed for a crisis."
 I think the 50 cal Barrett high-powered, anti-material, light anti-armor sniper rifle tucked in my gun rack gives me supreme power over the government. Especially if 300 million other people are similarly armed.
 
 300 million people armed against the possibility of the 1.4 million members of the US military being used in a coup. You tell me the odds in that situation. It's not the lone gunman with the Barrett 9 mm. Its the 300 million with hunting rifles, shotguns, semi-automatics, automatics, pistols, army surplus equipment, etc. that protect our liberties.
 
 If even 2% of the nation is armed, that means 6 million people able to stand against our standing military force of 1.4 million. You don't see that as an equalizer? Sure the military has better equipment. But as is often said in military circles, quantity creates a quality of its own. 2:1 odds? I'll take it. And I'll take 300:1 odds even more.
 
 "That was in the 1940s in a country where only one man ruled. George W Bush has a 535 member congress below him, ready to impeach him."
 Right, but Bush is not the one that wants to eliminate guns in the hands of civilians or eliminate their rights. I was saying what might happen if the american citizens are not allowed to have guns any more.
