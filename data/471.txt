TITLE: Forever against the United States

CATEGORY: Economics

Away in America, The land of freedom
 Aids, Corruption, Suffering and treason
 
 Where men are treated like the cattle
 But people of peace will win the battle
 
 Send them back your fierce defiance
 Stamp upon the NATO alliance
 
 And let our motto ever be
 For happiness, Against suffering
 
 Fear no danger, Need no sabers
 To protest against wars and traitors
 
 Shoulder pressing close to shoulder
 Let the odds make each heart bolder
 
 Outside, We went outside
 To conquer peace for people
 
 And swear upon the people's altar
 Never to submit or falter
 
 Till the enemies of the people are defeated
 Till the peace is achieved and happiness completed
 
 Advance the flag of happiness and equality
 Of easier life with real quality
 
 To the streets, To the streets we march in anger
 To conquer peace, And to save the world from danger
 
 We will all go to the United States
 Each American terrorist must understand
 That he must find a peace in his heart
 
 Ears of the world are deaf hearing about your wars
 You are the enemy of humanity
 You are the terrorist number one
 You are a death to harmony
 
 United States of America, You are dirty shame
 From your actions flow the juices of suffering
 You destroyed the land, And brought misery
 And disarranged the order of the world
 In front of our eyes, And in our hearts
 
 Your wealth is the blood of other countries
 In our chest, You are death, Which is taking lives away
 You are a thief of the land, Like the snake in the sand
 
 There is a misbehavior and injustice with you
 There is no any peace, You are a death for harmony
 You are the cause of revolt against human serenity
 
 You are the symbol of the death
 The enemy of humanity
 Your culture is tyranny
 It is breaking down society
 Far away can be heard
 The results of your attacks
 On the Earth, You are dark
 Leading us in the vile trap
 You are a worldwide enemy
 Scavenger on the suffering
 You are a terrorist number one
 The causer of the death and misery
