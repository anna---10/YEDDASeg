TITLE: The UK should send a military task force to the South Atlantic to deter Argentinean aggression

CATEGORY: Politics

Clearly the Argentinean government's memories of their country's failed attempt to seize the Falkland Islands in 1982 (1) have faded because, once again, Argentina has turned its beady little eyes to the islands, this time no doubt with the intention of getting their grubby hands on the oil reserves that have recently been discovered off the coast of this British Overseas Territory. (2,3)
 
 This treacherous bunch of tango-dancing greasers has belligerently laid siege to the Falklands by instigating a ban on all Falkland Island vessels docking in any Mercosur bloc port (4) â€“ meaning that Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay are all off-limits to ships flying the Falkland Islands' flag.
 
 The former First Sea Lord of the Royal Navy, Lord Alan West, recently suggested Britain should send a nuclear submarine to the Falklands and also undertake military exercises in response to the these antagonistic Argentinean autocrats' "aggressive" decision. (5)
 
 Lord West is right, a show of strength in the South Atlantic would send these bellicose bureaucrats in Buenos Aires the message that any more funny business from them will be dealt with swiftly and surely.
 
 Thank you.
