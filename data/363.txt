TITLE: Can lie detectors be used in court

CATEGORY: Society

Polygraph testing, now one of the most extensively employed forensic procedures, has been used in the investigation of crimes in the U.S. since the early 1900s. It is also widely used in many other countries, including Canada, Japan, and Israel. The value of the testing is said to lie in its helpfulness in exonerating innocent persons suspected of crimes. Polygraph results are admissible as EVIDENCE, in some U.S. courts. In many cases admissibility depends on mutual agreement by the opposing parties, although a few state courts have admitted polygraph results over the objection of one party.
