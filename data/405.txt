TITLE: Schools should teach more about the environment

CATEGORY: Economics

"   I didn't mean just kindergarten I meant all kids even young ones." 
 
  What defines a young kid? Why shouldn't we be educating 17 year olds? They're still in school. Throughout the debate, Pro didn't really seem too sure who should be learning this. 
 
  "Teachers can tell kids how to stop pollution and recycle." 
 
 Yes Pro is absolutely right here. Children can be TOLD how to do these things. This does not mean that they will retain this information, or that they will know what to do with it.

 Pro's entire closing argument seemed to completely disregard the issue that was presented in round 2: That current environmental education is terrible. Adding more bad education won't make it better. 10 spoiled oranges will not taste as good as one fresh orange.
