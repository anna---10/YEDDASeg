TITLE: THBT the Salem witch trials were a true parallel to the McCarthy investigation.

CATEGORY: Politics

Before I begin my speech, I would like to emphasise that our definition of the 'Salem witch trials' are from reference to that of the book "The Crucible by Arthur Miller". However, fear not, the events from the book do not deviate from the real version of the events very much.
 
 The proposition is not so much dependent on whether or not witches and communism were metaphysical or not, but rather, the true analogy lies in the willingness and the ease in which the judges and the public were willing to believe that there were. In the Salem witch trials, the victims, or more appropriately accusers of witchcraft did not really believe in witchcraft at all, e.g. Abigail Williams and the other girls are fully aware that their 'confessions' to witchcraft were done entirely in pretence. What is to be noted is the PUBLIC opinion and the prosecutors and judges who have so willingly believed in what the accusers have accused. As John Proctor supports this point by directly quoting: "Are all the accusers born holy in the name of God's fingers?" This reinforces our point on the willingness of Danforth (the judge) and the government of Salem in believing the accuser without much question. Likewise, this is also the case for communism. In both cases we see examples of mass hysteria that perpetuates rumours. We see the willingness of the general public and authority (Salem theocratic government represented by Danforth/Hathorne, and the US Government) to believe these rumours of witchcraft/communism without any substantial evidence.
