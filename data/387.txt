TITLE: Social Democracy

CATEGORY: Politics

Again i don't know what your point is. are you trying to say that social democratic countries are to peaceful? and mentioning the outlaw of the h jab in France, although I'm not in favor of this. the reason why this created such a controversy is because of France's Muslim population and that France is known to be a full complete democracy, Saudi Arabia on the other hand is a dictatorship ruled by a monarch; the freedom index shows that it is an authoritarian state where religion is instituted within its own government. i don't agree with both countries decisions since progress will only happen when the state leaves alone religion and doesn't have any ties to religion.
 
 Again before you applied that Hitler and Stalin were social democrats or it would seem, which they weren't.
 
 Another thing is is that im not sure what your point is about taking military action in the middle east. if in case your saying that you want to engage in a complete nuclear strike on the middle east then i think you really don't understand what would happen. All conservatives and libertarians alike don't want to go to war never mind nuclear war.
 
 If you really think that detonating nuclear weapons over the middle east is a good idea, then you really don't know enough of whats going to understand this debate
 
 So far we shifted from me trying to redefine what a dictatorship is to trying and trying to explain why its not a good idea to start a nuclear holocaust on the Muslim population.
 
 And let me remind you of who else has nuclear weapons. Russia and China both of which have ICBM's and thermonuclear weapons and will not stand for a nuclear genocide on the Muslims.
