TITLE: Cutting Taxes Would Stimulate The Economy

CATEGORY: Economics

"With tax cuts, business owners would either expand their business or lower the prices." Yeah in theory but they don't. In an ideal world maybe big business would give us a break. But people are greedy and immoral. The money wouldn't go to expanding business to give people jobs like you think your ideal world. The money goes to shareholders. And where do you think the working class get there money from huh? Taxes. They wouldn't be enjoying the tax cuts from the rich they get less money. With what your saying everyone would be paying less in taxes so who is paying taxes then becuase the government wouldn't have money to help up keep schools, roads ect ect.
