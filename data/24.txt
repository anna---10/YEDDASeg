TITLE: The United States needs to accept more refugees

CATEGORY: Politics

Well Donald Trump thinks differently and he isn't going to allow them to come to the USA. We are at war with Muslim radical jihadist that desire the destruction of the USA. What your saying has merit but unless there is a screening process to screen all the people coming in then they aren't going to let them in. My point is that the USA isn't a police state and the worlds protector. If the Syrians want freedom they need to turn around and fight ISIS and president Bashar Al Assad. Until they can establish freedom. In other word if the USA was invaded by North Korea or China or Russian of the ISLAMIC STATE I will take up arms and fight for the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. I love this nation and I don't care what people say or think about the USA. I love the USA and will die for this nation. I think that the Syrians should do the same for their country instead of running they should fight for their nation and for freedom.
