TITLE: Environmental Protection (con) + Police Profiling (pro)

CATEGORY: Politics


<<<outside of argumentation>>>
I'm happy do debate you on these topics.
 
 "I am for Environmental Protection in general, however, the way debate.org defines it is what I have a problem with.
 < 
 
<<<aspect1>>>
Emphasis on "AHEAD OF ECONOMIC POLICIES"
 The economy largely represents the well being of the people. I believe the well being of the people is more important than the well being of trees, plants, atmosphere... Although these also affect the well being of the people, a stable economy would help environmental protection while environmental protection brings down the economy."
 
 I think that the environment is more important than almost anything else at this point. I am absolutely disgusted by what is happening with our earth. I look at it this way, if we don't have a liveable earth tomorrow then the economy wont matter to anyone.
 
 Police Profiling:
 
 
<<<aspect2>>>
"It's a touchy issue because some people claim police profiling is "racist". However, if the police can say "A man was more likely to have choked this other man because the average woman wouldn't be strong enough to do it, then why can't the police also say "A black man was more likely to have shot this guy because statistics show that it's usually black men that shoot other people for money"? What's the difference?"
 
 I'm against police profiling because I don't think law enforcement should be given that kind of power. It is constantly misused.
