TITLE: The Democratic leadership is more capable of winning the War on Terror than the Republican leaders

CATEGORY: Politics

The most capable foreign policy genius, Joe Biden, Senator from Delaware, is the solution to America's international quagmires. Senator Biden is admired by the international community as a voice of reason who only has the best interests of America as priority.
 
 For this debate, my opponent should present a case supporting a politician from the Republican party whose ideas and leadership are better than what Joe Biden can offer. Although Joe Biden has withdrawn his Presidential bid, his appointment as a Vice Presidential nominee or Secretary of State would restore legitimacy to American foreign policy.
