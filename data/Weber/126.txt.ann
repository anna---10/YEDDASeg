TITLE: Is Gay Marriage is Completely Fine?

CATEGORY: Society


<<<aspect1>>>
Gay Marriage is completely fine. There is no harm to anyone when two persons of the same sex marry. In the constitution it says that Americans are entitled to the pursuit of happiness, and that is what this falls under, and when it says that marriage is between a man and woman in the bible people understand. Some people think they need to go and attack the homosexuals and tell them what they are doing is wrong. Whether it is wrong or not is to be decided by the person themselves, and not by somebody else. Gay marriage isn't a threat to the world so it is completely fine to be married to a person of the same sex.
