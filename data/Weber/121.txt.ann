TITLE: America is now, and has historically been, imperialist.

CATEGORY: Politics


<<<outside of argumentation>>>
I thank my opponent for taking this debate. 
<<<aspect1>>>
However, he has already admitted that, according to the definition of imperialism America is in fact an imperialist nation, he charges that America isn't enough of an imperialist nation to be called imperialist compared to more notorious nations.
 
 His admittance: "I believe that America has adopted a foreign national policy stance that can be summarized as "interventionist." I believe that America does attempt to coerce other nations in some regards, and that in many instances it could reasonably be construed as detrimental." All of this makes America fit the definition of imperialist. Interventionism, especially, is a government policy of exerting influence over things not under it's direct control.
 
 However, I intend to meet my opponent's challenge and not only point out his inadvertent forfeiture but to actually prove that America is now, and has historically been, imperialist. Read on. My opponent will have to maintain that the U.S. has never expanded its territories, let alone attempted to expand it's influence, to win this debate. Whether any nation can be called imperialist is irrelevant. Any human can be called mortal, this hardly makes the label untrue. Finally, whether any imperialist action is justified is entirely irrelevant. There is no moral judgment inherent in the term.

I'll also note that my opponent failed to follow the rules put forward in Round 1 and resorted to ad-hominem before the debate even began.

RESPONSES
 My opponent attempts to show that America is not imperialist by saying that anti-imperialism has always been a strong movement in the U.S. This is true, however, the definition judges by actions, not words and especially not words of half of a nation. Hypocrisy is not unheard of, especially in this nation, and especially when one considers our long history of "freedom" and who has been excluded from it. I will show that the policies and actions of America have been imperialist.
 
 
<<<aspect1>>>
My opponent also claims that American imperialism must be as bad as Nazism to count. This is ridiculous and arbitrary. The French, British, Spanish and even the Netherlands have all been successful imperialists to one degree or another, indisputably. All that is required for America to be imperialist is for it to fit the definition.
 
 INTRODUCTION TO US IMPERIALISM
 From it's very beginnings, before the U.S. was even severed from British control, American settlers pushed for direct territorial acquisitions. Once a nation, Americans began a long and slow push for land justified by their "Divine Mandate" not only westward but in the south and north as well. Its first acquisition was in 1783, the last in 1970. [1] In addition, the U.S. has attempted to exert control over other areas of the world politically and militarily.
 
 ORIGINS
 In fact, this was a factor in strained British-American and Indian-American relations. Early American settlers were mostly tobacco farmers, requiring more land for more profits, so they pushed into Indian territory, one example being Bacon's Rebellion. [2]
 
 EARLY IMPERIALISM
 Once the nation was solidified, the infamous march westward began, as the new nation slowly took Indian territory. Less known is the expansion to the south and north. For example, in the Mexican-American War, the U.S. took almost half of all Mexican territory, creating what is now the American Southwest. [3][4] It also purchased Alaska and continued to expand west, taking land from natives. Later, the American-Spanish War would mark the beginning of overseas expansion.
 
 GLOBAL CONFLICTS
 While the U.S. did not initially get involved militarily in WWI, it exerted its influence by supporting those already involved. They also attempted to impose their influence during the Russian Revolution. [5] And early on in WWII, America attempted to influence events by quietly providing support to its allies. The Cold War, of course, marks a major and long-term imperialist war by the U.S., as the entire point of the Cold War was influence and power. The U.S. exerted control via aid (long one of it's favorite tactics) and military support/intervention, as well as through the threat of nuclear war. [6] From there, you have numerous instances of America gaining and exerting political control, including: the Korean War (supporting pro-America allies), the Lebanon Crisis (supporting pro-America forces), and the Vietnam War (supporting pro-American forces). [7]
 
 MODERN IMPERIALISM
 Modern U.S. imperialism has continued its tactics of indirect control and small military intervention, either through support or direct conflict. [8][9][13][14] It has quietly supported foreign regimes whose policies are in its favor, and deposed those which are not. [10][11] In addition to these smaller, lesser-known acts of intervention and control, the recent "War on Terrorism" is a blatant and obvious show of interventionism. In addition to the war generally being interventionist, America has attempted to push pro-American Western ideals, forms of government, and even governments itself on affected countries.
 
 Currently, the departments of foreign affairs, including the Secretary of State admits, unknowingly, that it is imperialist. It's self-admitted policy is one of exerting influence for noble goals, and though it's doubtful whether the stated reasons are true, it doesn't matter. [12] The goal of American foreign policy is stated as working on "export controls, including nonproliferation of nuclear technology and nuclear hardware; measures to foster commercial intercourse with foreign nations and to safeguard American business abroad; International commodity agreements; international education; and protection of American citizens abroad and expatriation".
 
 Imperialism is "the policy, practice, or advocacy of extending the power and dominion of a nation especially by direct territorial acquisitions or by gaining indirect control over the political or economic life of other areas; broadly : the extension or imposition of power, authority, or influence".
 
 
<<<conclusion>>>
CONCLUSION
 America has long made territory acquisitions. It has long attempted to influence and control other areas more directly. Even today, foreign policy is a major factor in American politics and even a factor in voters' minds. Resolution affirmed: America is and has historically been imperialist.
