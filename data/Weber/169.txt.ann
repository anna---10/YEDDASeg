TITLE: You will discover the same laws of nature in anything and everything

CATEGORY: Science


<<<aspect1>>>
"If the same laws of nature can be discovered in anything and everything, then everyone will have same knowledge about each and everything."
 
 If anybody cannot see through this tissue paper thin assertion right off the bat, I beg you, just vote for con straight down the line.
 
 What next, if the traffic laws are all the same across the United States (they differ slightly in places but for the sake of analogy) are we to believe that everybody is equally skilled at driving? That if gravity is the same on Earth as on Mars that I should remember your father's last birthday? I'm sorry but one of the rules which is the same everywhere is that we exist as distinctly different people and in different locations and have different perspectives and different knowledge. But, this has nothing to do with the sameness of the underlying rules.
 
 
<<<outside of argumentation>>>
Your arguments have gotten stranger and less coherent. And you've never given a reasonable reason for the any broken symmetry. Nothing about the asymmetric nature of weak nuclear force, nothing supposing the slight muon bias towards matter, no arguments about variations of the speed of light near the big bang. Just generally a bunch of really silly questions.
 
 I had hoped for more out of this debate.
