TITLE: Marijuana should be legalized

CATEGORY: Society


<<<aspect1>>>
"The use and selling of Marijuana will tremendously boost our poor economy."
 If people don't have enough money to even live in a house then how will they have any money to buy this so called economy saver? I know for a fact if Marijuana was sold it would not be cheap. I feel that it wouldn't be bought because we have more than enough problems in America right now.

I also noticed that you used a website called the denverpost. That website seems incredibly biased considering it is in Colorado, the only state that has legalized marijuana.
