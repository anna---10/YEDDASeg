TITLE: Resolved: Tell others that the water will be shut off.

CATEGORY: Society

Logical-Master, thank you for taking this topic in a playful spirit. Your verse puts me to shame and raises expectations for your reasoning. So let's get to it. You would have Amy keep quiet because (1) nobody will believe a ten-year-old and (2) she lacks resources to convince others. Having declared her effort futile, you encourage Amy to (3) sell the water, albeit cheaply, and in doing so (4) teach her neighbors a lesson about being prepared.
 
 Let's take your second point first. If Amy had the resources to convince others, then they would believe her. Thus, your point (2) is a restatement of (1) and you've put forward only the one reason why she should keep quiet; namely, lack of credibility. You assert that people will not believe a ten-year-old, perhaps not even someone as senior as your 18 years. Now I understand what you believe, Logical-Master. Perhaps in the next round you could tell why you believe it.
 
 In the interim, let me step outside the aforementioned playful spirit to cite a reason why we must listen to children, especially when they appear sincere. Ours is a scary world of child abuse, neglect, bullying, and abandonment. The practice of dismissing an alert from a child is no longer an option. Don't get me wrong; telling neighbors about a water shortage is not in the same league as reporting abuse -- but then that is not my point. Rather, these unsavory realities have raised public awareness such that a child likely would be heard.
 
 If Amy will speak sincerely,
 others will hear clearly.
 
 To go further, even if people do not believe Amy directly, though it would seem they must, even then she could alert those who would in turn be believed. Perhaps she has an 18-year-old brother. Or that nice lady who lives kitty-corner. Or teaming up with Ann they can find strength in numbers as they plead a case to their mothers.
 
 OK, so Amy and Ann will be believed. Their lack of credibility was the foundation four your points (3) and (4), which thus fall like a house of cards. But let's examine the merits of these points anyway. Your point (3) is, essentially, to sell the water and stash the cash. Perhaps I am a bit harsh; sell it, but cheaply. Why? I suspect, Logical-Master, that you sense Amy would be taking advantage of others and so are hedging that fact with false altruism. Be consistent with your point (4) and allow her to leverage the principle of supply-and-demand to drive up prices. Sure she wants a bicycle, but you've made her an entrepreneur. In other words, Logical-Master, your third and fourth points are not consistent.
 
 Finally, it sounds like you would have Amy stick it to any boy-scout drop-out neighbors who just weren't prepared. The last vestige of altruism has been lost and your Amy is revealed to be an incredible, but otherwise aggressively entrepreneurial youngster. Well, when it comes to water, no wonder "evian" spelled backwards is "naive".
