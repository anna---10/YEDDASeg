TITLE: The more fear a government inflicts on its citizen, the greater risks of civil disorder it carries.

CATEGORY: Politics

Hello my opponent and all,
 This is my first debate on this site. I have been reading and following many other debates, but this is my first one. I fear I do not have much experience in terms of formatting and conventions, therefore, please correct and advise me whenever you can.
 
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 My position on this topic:
 The more fear a government inflicts on its citizen, the greater risks of violent civil disorder it carries. When the citizens is afraid of their own government, less likely there is political, social, and economic stability.
 
 All arguments will be posted from the second round.
