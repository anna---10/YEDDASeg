TITLE: Abortion should be legalized

CATEGORY: Politics


<<<outside of argumentation>>>
Introduction     
      
   Thank you logicalmaster123 and uniferous for accepting to do this team debate with us. We will be affirming and they will be negating the resolution that abortion should be banned. This is my (famousdebater’s) fourth team debate on the site and I have thoroughly enjoyed all of them so far. I am sure that this would be no exception. Thank you once again for your acceptance. Now we will begin our constructive case to convince voters and our opponent’s that the right to an abortion is something that we need within society.   
      
     Framework     
      
   
<<<aspect1>>>
Our framework will be centred around libertarianism. Within the ideology of libertarianism, there is great controversy on the subject of abortions because it all depends on whether the fetus is alive or not. If the fetus is alive then libertarians are against abortions because libertarians are individualists and therefore value the life of the individual heavily [1]. If the fetus is not alive then libertarians advocate abortion because libertarians belief in a less powerful and restrictive government. In our first contention we will prove the fetus to be living. For now we will explain why we should have an abortion under libertarian belief.   
      
    Capitalism magazine explains this well by saying,   
      
    “    A fetus does not have a right to be in the womb of any woman, but is there by her permission. This permission may be revoked by the woman at any time, because her womb is part of her body... There is no such thing as the right to live inside the body of another, i.e., there is no right to enslave... a woman is not a breeding pig owned by the state (or church).”     [2]   
      
      
    She is the individual that libertarians prioritize, due to their individualist ideologies [2]. Since libertarians believe in a less restrictive government the libertarian outcome is self-explanatory. The government should NOT be involved in something so personal to the person since by involving themselves in this person’s choice, you are restricting them and are ultimately violating libertarian ideology [3].    
      
      
     
<<<aspect2>>>
The Fetus Is Not Alive     
      
    Firstly, it is important to note that only 1.4% of abortions occur after 21 weeks into the pregnancy [3,4]. This means that that most abortions are done before the fetus is even formed. It is just an embryo, and an embryo is proven to be not alive, it is not a debate like with the fetus. It is a fact when referring to the embryo that it is not alive [5].   
      
    Now that this is covered, I will address the issue of the fetus - which is already mitigated due to the minute percentage of abortions that occur at this period into the pregnancy.   
      
    There are 7 categories in which life can be identified and this is often put into the acronym: MRS GREN to make it easier to remember [6]. The fetus only meets two of these.   
      
   Movement - The fetus can move so this part is met.  
   Respiration - The fetus cannot respire on its own (7).  
   Sensitivity - The fetus cannot sense at 24 weeks or even 28 weeks (8).  
   Growth - The fetus does grow.  
   Reproduction - Whilst it is a fetus, no it cannot reproduce (9).  
   Excretion - This is possible however very rare and unlikely (10).  
   Nutrition - The fetus cannot independently take in nutrition.  
   If one of these wasn’t met then the fetus would not be considered alive. The fetus was only able to meet 2 of these. Making it considered not alive scientifically (6).  
      
     
<<<aspect3>>>
Illegal Abortions    
   When an abortion is legal there is absolutely no point in having an illegal abortion because they have been proven to be very dangerous and expensive. If abortion are legal then illegal abortions will negatively correlate (11). These illegal abortions have been known to kill both the mother and the baby and sometimes result in extreme suffering on the mother’s part (11). Mothers are not doctors (most of the time) so these illegal abortions also occur later than 24 (and even 28) weeks meaning that the babies suffer too (11)!  
      
   Did you know that:  
      
    “13% of pregnancy-related deaths worldwide are related to complications of unsafe abortion.”(12)   
      
   This statistic is shocking but demonstrates my point very well. These unsafe abortions are illegal abortions and this is what is currently happening because abortions are illegal in places. They have no option to a safe abortion and are so desperate for abortion that they attempt to undergo illegal and unsafe abortions. Therefore, we can conclude that there are a huge number of unsafe abortions (13% of all pregnancy related deaths). From this we can then follow up an argument suggesting that making abortions illegal will not necessarily get rid of all abortions therefore rendering our opponent’s aim to be mitigated.   
      
     
<<<aspect4>>>
Underage teenagers    
      
    “19% of teens who have had sexual intercourse become pregnant each year. 78% of these pregnancies are unplanned. 6 in 10 teen pregnancies occur among 18-19 year olds.” (12)   
      
   This statistic is significant for many reasons. If this occurs amongst 18 - 19 year olds then this is extremely bad. Having to look after and care for a child ruins their chances of going to university. Your twenties are your most important period of your lives according to many sources (13,14,15). Having to look after a child in this period of time is extremely stressful and prevents you from getting proper qualifications and more importantly, it prevents you from getting a full time job and a house. Children are extremely expensive to have and having a child at the time when you should be looking for a job makes income problematic. On top of this you will have to pay huge amounts of money.  
      
    “To raise a child born in 2013 to the age of 18, it will cost a middle-income couple just over $245,000, according to newly released estimates from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That's up $4,260, or almost 2%, from the year before.”(16)   
      
   Now let's compare this to the average income of a family:  
      
    “The typical U.S. households pulls in $51,371 per year.”    
      
   Teenage parents are most likely to make a lot less than this but let's take this statistic anyway. Assuming that this ‘average’ family spend no money at all on anything. It will still cost them almost 5 times their yearly income to equate to that amount. Of course they will need food, clothes, mortgage, heating, electricity etc. on top of this sum of money.  
      
   If this seems like a lot you should double the cost of a child figures (assuming that they have another child), what will you do then? Not allow an abortion? Allow these teenagers to pay almost $500,000, earning (most likely) less than $51,371 per year.   
      
     
<<<aspect5>>>
Gender Equality    
      
   Pregnancies have a huge impact upon people’s lives - in particular the mother. As Sarah Weddington stated:  
      
    “A pregnancy to a woman is perhaps one of the most determinative aspects of her life. It disrupts her body. It disrupts her education. It disrupts her employment. And it often disrupts her entire family life.” (17)   
      
   She continued:  
      
    “[And we feel that], because of the impact on the woman, this … is a matter which is of such fundamental and basic concern to the woman involved that she should be allowed to make the choice as to whether to continue or to terminate her pregnancy.” (17)   
      
   This was a very important case showing that without the right to a termination, you are denying women a right and therefore what my opponent is advocating is gender inequality.  
      
   The philosopher, Judith Thomson said:  
      
    “If abortion rights are denied, then a constraint is imposed on women's freedom to act in a way that is of great importance to them, both for its own sake and for the sake of their achievement of equality .... and if the constraint is imposed on the ground that the foetus has a right to life from the moment of conception, then it is imposed on a ground that neither reason nor the rest of morality requires women to accept, or even to give any weight at all.” (17)   
      
   This emphasizes my previous point in regards to the denial of gender rights and equality and therefore we come to the following conclusion:  
      
   P1: Denying women an abortion is gender inequality  
   P2: Gender inequality is a violation of human rights  
   C1: Abortion legalization stops gender inequality rights  
   C2: Abortions should be legalized  
      
     
<<<aspect6>>>
Mother’s Life    
      
    “The risk of death associated with childbirth is about 10 times as high as that associated with abortion.” (12)   
      
   This means that in almost ANY circumstance, an abortion is safer than a pregnancy - even if the abortion is for reasons unrelated to health.  
      
   99% of all pregnancy related deaths occur in countries that have no option to an abortion (18). The correlation is evident between the lack of abortion and the maternal mortality. By the end of 2015, 303,000 mothers would have died due to the lack of abortion availability (18).

Conclusion     
   To conclude we have shown through strong evidence that abortions should be legalized and we hand it back over to our opponents for their case. The resolution is affirmed.
