TITLE: if everyone likes you then you do not have a personality.

CATEGORY: Society


<<<outside of argumentation>>>
To clear the confusion, firstly I intend  to start with the definition of 'personality' and 'everyone'. 
 
   Personality -  the set of emotional qualities, ways of behaving, etc., that makes a person different from other people         Everyone     - means “everybody” and is used when you want to refer to all the     people in a group.          Because of the ambiguity of the debate title, I will assume that everyone means the people one knows and has met in his/her group of circle as it is impossible for every single one in the world to truly get to know someone. 
 
 ’No personality’ meaning someone who does not have a set of emotional qualities.         I would like to give two people as unforgetten examples.         1.  Mother Teresa.  Mother Teresa chose to become a nun despite the hardships that would come with it and dedicated her whole life to serving the poor. After the founding of the Missionaries of Charity, she received an international approbation and won the Nobel Peace Prize. Even after she died, many people still serve her as an example to living a life of altruism and selflessness.          Her kind, gentle, loving personality was what people look up to her thus, becoming a role model of charity and service.

 2.  Steve Jobs or any other genius creator for that matter.  The creator of the famous Apple product who earned many respect and admiration for his foundation. He too had a distinct character that enabled his imagination to become reality. I propose you watch his speech here.      https://www.ted.com...

Personality is something flexible. However, it is impossible to have 'no personality' or no sets of emotional qualities because everyone has emotions and feelings but it's just that no one truly tried to get to know them properly.       
 This moves to my next point, which will mention the importance of truly getting to know a person before judging him/her. The reason why people start to hate each other is just because they seem different. However, if they truly get to stand in the person's shoes then they will be able to understand why they are atheists, why they do drugs or why they dont, why they act that way.

My second argument is that everyone is capable of being liked or has the possibility of being liked by everyone they know . This is because humans have the power to empathize with another. The empathy in itself serves as an emotional quality of a person and that is why someone who is liked by everyone is capable of doing such thus, maintaining his/her character.
