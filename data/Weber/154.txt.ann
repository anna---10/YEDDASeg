TITLE: Saddam Hussein Was Good

CATEGORY: Politics


<<<aspect1>>>
Your statement about ISIS running rampant without him implied that if he was still in control it would subside. Which is absolutely wrong, and perhaps one man did say those things on BBC. There has been refugees coming over to America because of Saddam, how was he a good leader ,If his own citizens want to escape his reign. I am not saying that Iraq was better currently than it was in his rule, I am saying that he is not a GOOD leader. Most of his citizens lived in poor built houses, healthcare was not taken cared of that much. All he did was make the poor poorer and the Rich Richer.Just because Isis made Iraq worst does not mean Saddam was a good leader. Just because horrible people make something that was already horrible more terrible does not mean its original leader was good if so then Iraq would have no have been in that state before.
