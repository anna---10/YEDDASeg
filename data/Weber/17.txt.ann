TITLE: If the world was run by women, our civilization would reach stagnation.

CATEGORY: Society

I know the title sounds as if the debater is a troll, but I am not. If you look at my profile and my debates, you will see that I am a serious debater.
 
 I will start with my educational background and resources.
 
 My Background:
 A-Level psychology
 Business management bsc
 Various popular psychology books
 33 years of life Experience
 
 Most of my resources rely on:
 The Female Brain by Louann Brizendine
 Psychology for A2 Level by Michael W. Eysenck, Cara Flanagan
 Gender differences documentaries
 
 I want the debater to post a similar post, describing himself and the resources that he will use. It is a 5 round debate and Max character per post, so I would invest more time if the debater is good or is serious to challenge me.
