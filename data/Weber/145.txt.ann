Sorry for my delay time got away from me. Now then as far as your points go there is some truth to them. 
<<<aspect1>>>
I do agree government is getting too much power and controls too much of the nation as it is, however, having churches and other fundraisers to raise money for welfare would just not work. The money needed to fund those on welfare would far exceed what private fundraisers could provide. I believe the government should control welfare but it should be regulated. The way it is now is too flawed and needs to solve the problem of poverty and unemployment rather than provide free money to those on welfare. a "time limit" so to speak would allow those who are unemployed or in tough times to get themselves back on their feet and get back out into the job market. The time limit would also create incentive to work knowing that the people cannot just feed off of the welfare system. The government does an okay job regulating welfare it just needs to be upgraded not dispatched.
