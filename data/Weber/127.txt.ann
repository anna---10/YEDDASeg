TITLE: Evolution is an unjustified axiom of faith

CATEGORY: Science

My opponent forfeited a second time; how unfortunate :( 
 I ask that I receive the conduct point for his two consecutive forfeits.

Analysis:   
  My opponent seems confused in a post-facto view of evolutionary biology. He sees this body of evidence and makes the claim that it is just an assumption or an unfalsifiable hypothesis (act of faith). However, when the science of evolution subsumes the massive, collective work in the fields of chemistry, biology, biochemisty, molecular biology, developmental biology, population biology, mammalogy, ornithology, botany, zoology, herpetology, ecology, genetics, ethology, biogeography, epidemiology, psychology, and population genetics without evidence to the contrary, while making and confirming predictions we can be lead to believe that evolution is a highly accurate scientific theory.

Furthermore, Science is a falsifiable endeavor. If a body of evidence emerges that demonstrates evolution to be false or inaccurate, the truth-power of evolution will be diminished and evolution as a science may see its end. However, the argument, evidence, and reason all point to evolution being a highly successful and accurate scientific theory.

Science relies on a set of assumptions, but that does not, therefore, mean that its findings are assumed. The rigorous research, testing, and peer review process makes sure that data and evidence are of the highest quality.

<<<conclusion>>>
Conclusion  
  Since evolution is a branch of science, and science is a falsifiable endeavor, which grants truth value to theories in proportion to evidence, evolution is not an unjustified axiom of faith, but rather a justified branch of science based on evidence and reason.
