Wow, uh, that isn't like you said it would be. I thought it would be really laid-back. Given your proposal, you only allow me to say that we should stand back and watch. That is rather unfair. I will try my best!
 
 
<<<aspect1>>>
When looking into this situation, Taiwan has not requested US aid. Not once in my opponent's sources do they actually request our aid. Is it possible that the US should not be policing the world? Is it possible that the rest of the world's affairs might not be ours? 
<<<outside of argumentation>>>
my opponent gave me no room to propose anything realistic, so I will add on a vital piece of information to his proposal, making the amended proposal my own. 
<<<aspect1>>>
I propose that we take action as my opponent suggested, only if and when Taiwan asks us. They may have a strategy, plan, or other device to work things to their benefit. If we go barging in on their affairs, we might interfere with the good of Taiwan. I propose we take all necessary action, ONLY IF AND WHEN Taiwan requests it.

Thank you.
 
 (Might I suggest a new scenario for next round? Something less one-sided?)
