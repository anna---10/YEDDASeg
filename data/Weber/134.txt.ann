TITLE: Top Tax Rate should be the Tax Optimizing Rate

CATEGORY: Politics


<<<aspect1>>>
Government should be limited, and its scope shall extend only to protect the fundamental
 rights of Americans to their life, liberty, and their property; as well as to adjudicate
 any disputes that may arise through the judicial system.    The taxes required to fund such a government would be relatively light.     With a laissez-faire economic policy, government would foster prosperity and a
 flourishing society. People would have higher incomes which would allow individuals to spend, save, and invest
 more.     Businesses would be free to compete, expand, and invest in capital. With capital accumulation, America would have more production and a higher capacity to produce more goods â€“ thus there would
 be higher output and therefore America would be wealthier and enjoy a higher
 standard of living (GDP).    These assertions have been empirically proven by the National Bureau of Economic
 Statistics [1].    So the wealthy can invest in ways that improve their own financial situations, as well
 as raising the standards of living for other Americans. If General Motors invests in advanced capital
 which raises its output, and expands its operations, more employees are hired,
 society is wealthier and economic growth occurs.
