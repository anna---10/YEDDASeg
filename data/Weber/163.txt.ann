CATEGORY: Politics

How about a joke?
 
 So a blonde, a brunette, and a redhead just died and were at the steps of Heaven. God told them "there are 1000 steps to Heaven. On every step, I will tell you a joke, and if you don't laugh once you get to go to Heaven."
 
 The brunette lasted 14 steps before laughing, the redhead 35.
 
 The blonde stepped onto the 999 step and laughed. God said "I didn't even tell you the joke yet !"
 
 The blonde said "I know, I just got the first one".
