<<<outside of argumentation>>>
I"ve enjoyed debating with you Con! Best of luck to you too!
 
 For my concluding argument, I will summarize the arguments that were made throughout this debate, and attempt to convince voters why Pro should win:
 
 
<<<aspect1>>>
Arg 1 " The Thirteenth Amendment addresses slavery, not conscription in a time of war
 In round 2, I argue, using Supreme Court evidence, that the Thirteen Amendment was written specifically to prevent the enslavement and forced servitude of blacks. At the time the Thirteenth Amendment was written, conscription had been heavily used in the Civil War by both the Union and Confederacy, so if it had been part of the reason fueling the amendment, it would have been specifically addressed in one of the sections of the amendment, which it was not.
 
 
<<<aspect2>>>
Arg 2 " Conscription is bad for education/economy
 
<<<outside of argumentation>>>
In Round 3, Con willingly forfeits these arguments
 
 
<<<aspect3>>>
Arg 3 " Conscription is required to protect the national security of a country
 I show Supreme Court evidence and constitutional evidence citing the government"s obligation to protect the nation and the government's right to build and fund an army and navy. Con"s argument is that a volunteer army would be sufficient, but as I stated, in a time of serious war, a bigger army may be needed to protect the national security of a country, and thus it is the government"s constitutional obligation to conscript.
 
 
<<<aspect1>>>
Arg 4 " Conscription is tantamount to slavery/involuntary servitude
 While this may be true in a literal way, it is a constitutional form of slavery/involuntary servitude. There are provisions in the Constitution that make it legal, as I have stated before. It is no different than taxation, which is also a form of slavery/involuntary servitude that is constitutional because it is required to protect the national security of the nation and to allow the government to operate. Both taxation and conscription are powers granted to the government by the Constitution.

I feel that I have defended the constitutionality of conscription well! Vote Pro!
