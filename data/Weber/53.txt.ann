TITLE: Gun Rights: Should we have guns?

CATEGORY: Politics


<<<aspect1>>>
"No, this is not a matter of what I think and what you think, but a debate of logic. As I said, the data contradicts itself when location varies, thus the data cannot be used for every location.", yet we've looked at the American data and this is a question of American rights if I am not mistaken so it should not matter. I've shown the data that alludes to America, to other countries, you cited Canada, and I've cited the mentality of violence and the differences between countries that manage their firearms with low homicidal rates and countries like America that have extremely high homicidal firearm rates. I am unsure where the inconsistency lies other than the reality that guns don't protect people at all and they do indeed only endanger people when the mentality of the locale is not conducive to their presence.

"Okay, I have to object to this and point out the inconsistency of your logic. If statistics show that you are more likely to shoot yourself than defend yourself, let me pose a question for you. Do you think a suicidal person would not kill themselves just because they did not have access to a gun?", actually as it turns out

no! Impulsive suicide is much, much higher with access to firearms than not! So while it wasn't my intention at all you've also shown that for those who are mentally unstable whether it be depression or something more serious access to firearms is generally a high risk factor in suicide

"Let me remind you: There is more than one way to skin a cat. So, the issue of a suicidal having access to guns is solved.", indeed it is; you see the numbers I cited for deaths relative to the firearms were actually accidental. That means that there were no suicides accounted for. You point out suicide so getting numbers on that is possible but I don't think that would help your case and honestly from the information above it's been shown that it's all the worse now.
 
 "There would be no gap in the amount of suicides if we were to take guns away.", and this is a claim you have to statistically prove. Just like violence and crime suicidality changes in the world based on mentality; Japan for instance and other Eastern countries have pretty high suicide rates but an entirely different culture related to suicide while countries that don't have much suicide despite their standing as impoverished have different values. To that end I don't see how you could measure this in the United States despite looking at the numbers and facts above and seeing that a vast amount (majority) of suicides involve firearms.

"Therefore, I rephrase your argument...", do not do that.

"The criminals will have guns. We will not. This is a frightening concept when you consider that gun crimes usually result in more fatalities than knife crimes. And so, even though the criminal did it, the gun allowed more damage to be done.", this is fearmongering behavior and emotional but it doesn't matter because nothing you've said actually backs this up. I just showed that most criminals get firearms through some form of legal chain meaning that whether it's a straw purchase or a gift or even legally buying the weapon to perform a first-offender activity you find yourself at greater risk. That's just numerically and statistically true and it is that way just about worldwide with only 9 countries, as shown prior, outdoing America for gun related murders and crimes.
 
 To be blunt there is no bad guy with a gun waiting for your rights to be taken away. He doesn't exist. It is a complete myth built off of fear but as you said, 
<<<outside of argumentation>>>
"No, this is not a matter of what I think and what you think, but a debate of logic.", so I ask to you: Why do you keep appealing to emotion?
 
 "And I do not see how criminals breaking laws is that hard to believe, much less a complex question that requires a paragraph of an answer.", it's a pointless statement. In order to be a criminal you have to break the law so saying "Criminals break the law" is not an argument, it's a stated definition, and using a definition to propose that there is some meaning behind that is faulty. It's misleading. It's why I used the example "Unmarried men are bachelors", or X|X, particularly because it's not intelligible.
 
 
<<<aspect3>>>
"Regardless, I should think a crime is easier to commit when you know the victim is unarmed.", but as you said it's not about what you think. The problem with this is that it sounds logical, but it isn't, the factors that go into crime are rarely as simple as "does he have a gun?"

We've studied this for years and years because we wanted to know as well if such a thing were true and it turns out it's not. Since most criminals attack people they know whether it be petty thievery or something grievous like rape and murder your defense against these people is already low to begin with. It is difficult to do more than show this overwhelming amount of psychological information and statistical data that has been consistent for over a decade showing that none of this is actually true.
 
 
<<<aspect4>>>
"And also, you do understand that if guns become illegal, criminals will still have access to guns. If the gun they possess is legal, they can always get another one through the black market.", this is ambiguous. First is the question of whether the gun exchange goes down or not; as shown above there is no need for this insane "black market" at current so the concept that petty criminals will suddenly slip into this black marketplace and get access to incredible caches is farfetched and there's no sound reasoning behind it. There's no data that suggests this. I mean even the countries with the lowest gun crime and the tightest controls and the best mentality for those controls have gun crime, so obviously there will be gun crime, but the notion that it will somehow maintain itself and there will be a super-wave of criminals reaching out and grabbing magazines by the ton just seems less and less likely as we look at the data and really analyze it.

I know it seems rude but functionally this comes down to two words: "Prove it." You've no sources. You've nothing but your own opinion and it's just not congruent to reality.
