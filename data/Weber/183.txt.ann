TITLE: Gene Therapy

CATEGORY: Science


<<<aspect1>>>
You said that gene therapy is cheaper than many treatments, is that entirely accurate though? Gene therapy is very expensive, some people may be able to afford chemotherapy but not gene therapy. The stated cost was 25,000. Let's be honest who woupd be able to pay that amount of money for that therapy. In todays economy not a lot of money like that is owned by a lot of people.

In this final argument the actual risks and disadvantages of gene therapy will be talked about. Mayo foundation for medical education and research has proven that many serious problems (there is a high risk of them happening) could happen. A few of these risks include unwanted immune system reaction. This is where inflammation amd even serious cases of organ failure can happen. Another major health issue that can happen is targeting the wrong cell. An altered virus from the therapy infects other cells and causes major damage to these said cells. "Other illnesses and disease can start to happen because of this including cancer" is stated by Mayo foundation for medical education and research. Possible formation of a tumor is a likley possibility of gene therapy too. In gene therapy it is not comman to accidentally insert the gene into a wrong cell or area. This could lead to tumor formation in the area which can start a chain reaction that can turn fatal. These all have been documented problems seen by Mayo foundation for medical education and research. These are only a few of the problems tha can accure with gene therapy and there are way more not told in this argument.
