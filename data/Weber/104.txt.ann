Well my good sir, the homosexual community would know that most of the population is heterosexual and most likely will not flirt with them thats why there are gay bars and hang out spots for the homosexual community. You don't just go up to a female slap her buttox and "damn girl I want to do you so hard" if you do you are insane and are deserving of a punch in the face. The fact is people deal with all types
 Of awkwardness through out there lifetime without homosexuals in the picture they
 Deal with it when the opposite sex ask them out and they turn it down that's still awkward. You can't run away from awkwardness with or without the homosexual community. Awkwardness is a part of life.
