TITLE: Fake rape case is a lethal weapon for women

CATEGORY: Society


<<<aspect1>>>
Dewott knight, I respect your argument and understand that "fake" rape accusations in America are less(2-8%), but it exists, right? may be less but a crime is a crime. Anyways, America is a developed country and a superpower, but there are many countries which are developing and have these "fake" cases very high in number.I am primarily talking about India, in which after the Nirbhaya rape incident 2012 in Delhi (you can google it-it was a brutal gang rape incident in a bus which resulted in the death of the victim sadly),the" fake" rape accusations have increased up to 53% in 2013. I don't think that is by any means a small number, come on knight, it's more than half of the accusations. I agree that a real rape is a brutal crime against both men and women(out of every 10 rape victims, 1 is a male), and I am not denying that it requires the harshest of punishments. But what about this 53% figure. Shouldn't these men be given justice equally. Shouldn't these women be equally prosecuted and punished severely, but sadly this is not happening. As I said in my last argument, these women face maximum 6 months in prison, that's it. I am against this situation of the society.

And you probably don't know that in India, recent rules which have been made are very much women centered and biased against men. Ex- In case of a "fake" rape accusation, the accused will be thrown into jail without a bail option, as rape is a non compoundable and a non bailable crime, and investigations will start later unlike America, which means that based on these 53% "fake" accusations, many men are imprisoned without a trial(which comes later), and even in a trial in India these men face a tough time proving these accusations "fake", as I said that rules are 100% women centered. Some of these biased rules are-
 1- sexual harassment is "NOT" gender neutral (zero protection to men, 100% to women)
 2-Act of intent to disrobe or stripping forcefully someone is "NOT" gender neutral (protects only women and not men)
 3-Voyeurism is "NOT" gender neutral (protects only women)
 4-Stalking is "NOT" gender neutral (protects only women)- 1 in 19 men have been victim of stalking in "AMERICA"
 5- section 498-A- If a women accuses husband of dowry demand, he and his entire family will be thrown into jail on the basis of just a complaint(trial will start later on). It is a non bailable offence and is being "MISUSED" on a large scale.(google it)
 6- Domestic violence act 2005- only women are protected but "NOT" men, and BTW, in domestic violence cases in India, 40% victims are Men, but they don't have a single law to be protected, sadly)
 and many more such rules exist in India.
 Well, my argument is just that under such rules and conditions, it's very hard for a man to prove himself innocent in cases of "Fake" rape accusations, and even if they do, as I said , there is no punishment for these "53%" bitches.

MY argument is that they should be severely and harshly punished, the same way the accused is punished in a real rape case.
