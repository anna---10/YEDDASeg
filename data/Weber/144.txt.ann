TITLE: Germs are not the cause of disease.

CATEGORY: Science


<<<outside of argumentation>>>
The second statement clarifies and elaborates on the first statement. Quote - "It was their lack of vitamins that caused it" Is a clarification.

"There is a percentage of people who do get sick to lyme disease"
  
 Says who? The doctors? The same people who earn a living from the germ theory of disease. Now, Any person who makes a living off sick people surely wants a secure future which contains lots of sick people to treat. Thus, The medical doctors have no financial incentive to cure or prevent any disease. Thus, They keep quiet about the real cause of disease and make heaps of money because of their tacitness.

Quote -  "that Ebola as a whole is from pesticide. The disease has existed longer than even the invention of the product in the first place. " 
 
  Ebola virus   was   first discovered   in 1976 near the   Ebola   River in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo. Since then, The   virus   has been infecting people from time to time, Leading to outbreaks in several African countries. 
 
   Note - Pesticides were first invented in about 1890. That's 86 years before the Ebola virus first appeared. Thus, Your statement is false by a long shot. 
 
 
  "Now we are facing almost the same fate as the europeans did during the Black Death"
 
  You have changed disease once again! Amazing! 
 
 
<<<aspect2>>>
The Black Death was a result of volcanic activity during the Dark Ages. That's why they call it the Dark Ages because it was literally dark due to volcanic ash. This caused crop failure and starvation. People had to rely on stored grain food to survive. Grain food causes leaky gut syndrome and results in the Black Death which is a vitamin deficiency disease.

"But do you really think that is the case with every study in the whole of society? "
 
  
<<<aspect1>>>
Doctors have always decieved people right throughout history. Witch doctors used to shake sticks to ward off evil spirits. Nothing has changed that much. Vaccination is based on prehictoric rites of blood initiation. The blood of animals was once thought to contain super powers because animals were so strong and fast compared to puny humans. This belief led Edward Jenner to think that by injecting animal blood into humans that the spirit of the strong animal would make the sick person better. Its just an old wives tale gone wrong.
