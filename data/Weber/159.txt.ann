TITLE: Legalizing gay marriage

CATEGORY: Politics


<<<aspect1>>>
There is nothing that says homosexuals cannot live together. There is nothing that says they cannot have children, in the case of Elton John, or adopt them. However, marriage is a  tradition  that should not be changed; traditions are made to kept, not to be changed at will.
 
 I agree that people would get used to it, however there will still be some who disagree strongly.
 
 
<<<aspect2>>>
I believe that the majority of homosexuals would not want to draw undue attention to their sexuality; who they choose to live with is a private matter and should not be publicised.
 
 
<<<aspect3>>>
I also think they would feel pressured into getting married. We passed a law saying they could so a certain thing so they would feel obliged to do it, even if they do not want to.
