TITLE: Transgenderism Is A Mental Illness

CATEGORY: Science


<<<aspect1>>>
A man who claims to be a woman "on the inside" should not be considered a normal, sane person. A man, who has X and Y chromosomes, can never have X and X chromosomes, such as a woman does. 
<<<outside of argumentation>>>
It is not offensive to say this, it is never offensive to say the truth. What is offensive is when people are called "transphobic" for using their head. 
<<<conclusion>>>
A man cannot, and will never, change into a woman and the same goes vice versa.
