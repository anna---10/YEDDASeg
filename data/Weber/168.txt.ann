<<<outside of argumentation>>>
I am going to say this right off the bat, I will probably not list any sources, I am just going to place my thoughts and hope that the voters will side with me.

There is a reason the INTERPOL changed from calling it "child pornography" to "child abuse" because that is what it is. The reason it is frowned upon and illegal because it is not children setting up a webcam and performing sexual acts for people willingly, it's children being forced to take place in these acts against their will. It is also abuse because not only are these people raping these children, they are beating them black and blue and a lot of the times it might even end with the children being murdered for the pleasure of the raper and the viewers who think it is arousing and have probably done something similar themselves.

And I have a question for you mostlogical. Is there any age limit to what you think "child porn" should be? Because 90% of the children in "child porn" are under the age of 12 and have not undergone puberty yet. Some are not even children yet, they are just babies. I really don't think babies are consenting to take part in these acts.

There are a few more rounds so I will hold off any further arguments for them.
