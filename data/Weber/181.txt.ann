TITLE: Gay marriage can and should be legalized

CATEGORY: Politics


<<<outside of argumentation>>>
Thank you for the debate.
 I'm not going to give reasons why homosexuality (not gay marriage) is wrong, since if you do not believe in God, then there is no reason it should be wrong. I completely understand this. My case will be that gay marriage destroys marriage. That if we allow anyone, and anything to marry, why does marriage exist at all? I will begin with the case for gay marriage (point I) and then move on from there.
 
 
<<<aspect1>>>
I. Why does marriage have to be between MALE and FEMALE? Why cannot marriage be between two people who love each other? We should allow gay marriage.
 
 II. Why does marriage have to be between two HUMANS? We should allow marriage to be between all species and creatures. Humans should be allowed to marry animals.
 
 III. Why does marriage have to be between TWO beings? We should allow groups of people to get married at once.
 
 IV. Why does marriage have to be between ADULTS? If two people love each other, then they should be allowed marriage. Adults should be allowed to marry children.
 
 V. Why cannot marriage be between RELATIVES? Obviously, because their children will have birth defects, however, the children need not be their own children. Also, they may be gay anyway. Relatives should be allowed to be married.
 
 
<<<aspect2>>>
a. Gay marriages cannot reproduce. Then what is the meaning of sex? If it is merely for pleasures sake, then it should not be associated with marriage at all. Sex should be between anyone if it fulfills its purpose of pleasure.

b. Read Brave New World, by Aldous Huxley, a futuristic book where sex and reproduction lose all meaning.
 
 
<<<aspect3>>>
c. Lesbian marriages will use often use artificial insemination from a donor to have children. These children will never know their true father. There is nothing necessarily wrong with a child not knowing their true parents, but when a child is missing a male or female influence, some issues will arise.
 
 Although studies show there are many children of gay couples who have no unusual issues, many of these studies are specifically made to support gay marriage. I would like to commend those who are successful without considerable fatherly or motherly influence caused by gay marriage, but still, I do not think the studies show the whole story. Part of the issue is that many children from heterosexual parents are lacking in a father of mother influence as well due to poor parenting or divorce. Most of the time, homosexuality in males is caused by a negative experience with his father [1]. This shows that a good fatherly influence is very important in a boy's life. Conversely when they are without fatherly influence at all, there are often negative results. "Many adult sons abandoned by their fathers have difficulty developing and sustaining self-esteem, forming lasting emotional attachments, recognizing their feelings, or being expressive with their adult partners and children." [2]
 Obviously, a lack of a father or mother does not necessarily adversely affect children in all cases, showing that peoples' character is not necessarily influenced by their environment. However, I still stress an importance of a fatherly or motherly figure in a child's life.

d. The only way all the purposes of marriage can be fulfilled is between a man and a woman. You have romantic love, physical love, reproduction, and raising a family in a proper manner. Allowing gay marriage is the precursor of destroying marriage altogether.
