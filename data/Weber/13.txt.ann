TITLE: Why Heavy Gun Control Is Bad and Why The Second Ammendment Is Good

CATEGORY: Society


<<<aspect1>>>
OK let me start with what the second amendment is, the right to bear arms to form a well regulated militia; IN A TIME OF WAR! The second amendment was created when we were fighting for our freedom against the British. While I am no fan of violence, it makes sense that citizens would need to carry weapons in the case of an attack. However, we are not at currently at war on our home soil where people would need to carry weapons for self defense, and therefore the second amendment is void.

Next, I think you may not be in favor of gun control due to things like terror attacks and/or school shootings. 80% of school shootings are done with legally bought guns. If banning guns would stop 4 in 5 shootings then I am all in. Also heavy gun control would make it harder to get illegally bought guns so this furthers my point. Gun control may make it harder for you to hunt, but that is not the freaking problem of the now dead students.

I look forward to your next statement :)
