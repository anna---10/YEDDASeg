TITLE: Reciprocity of conceal carry permits.

CATEGORY: Politics


<<<outside of argumentation>>>
um...
 
<<<aspect1>>>
first, i don't see a need to carry a concealed gun traveling across states
 
<<<aspect2>>>
second, you have no option except to follow the rules unless you try to run for some government position
 
<<<aspect3>>>
third, the CCW permit clearly have the name of the state on them
 
<<<aspect3>>>
fourth, different state have different requirements for a CCW permit
 
<<<aspect3>>>
fifth, if this restriction between different states is not set up, there are too many loop holes people can find because each state have different governments and set up different laws
