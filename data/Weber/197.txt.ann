TITLE: High Schools should have a designated smoking area

CATEGORY: Society


<<<outside of argumentation>>>
Hello and good morning, afternoon or evening. This is my very first debate of this kind so, as many others on this site seem to plead, be gentle with me.
 My argument is about tobacco use, albeit tailored to a more specific issue. I wish to argue that a high school where students from the ages of 14-18 attend, and some of which smoke, should have a designated area for those people to smoke. More details will be revealed in my list of arguments, which follows:
 
<<<aspect1>>>
1. The first issue, as it always is, is of free choice. One thing I will highlight for my opponent to use is that some of the students are not of legal age to buy cigarettes, but I am still arguing for the smoking area. For me to succeed, I must prove that, not only should the students have the choice to smoke, the school they attend should support them by providing the facilities.
 2. Secondly, the purpose of having the area must be defined and defended.

I will wait to see what my opponent has to say on this subject before revealing myself.
 
<<<aspect3>>>
3. Thirdly, and lastly, for now, is the issue of the psychological addiction that is gripping the students. A great supporter to my cause is that the school grounds are quite extensive – a student must walk at least ten minutes to leave them, and then they would only reach forest – therefore, without a designated area within school grounds, children with cravings that they wish to subdue would surely smoke on school ground, perhaps even in the school (in one of the less monitored hallways or stairwells) resulting in an increased threat of second-hand smoke and fires, along with the garbage that will be spread around instead of contained.

I will await the reply of my opponent.
