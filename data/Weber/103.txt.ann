TITLE: Adolph Hitler was an Atheist

CATEGORY: Politics


<<<outside of argumentation>>>
Alrighty, let's get crackin'...
 
 I believe we require definitions so here they are
 
 Adolph Hitler:A German political leader of the twentieth century, born in Austria. Hitler's early program for Germany is contained in his book Mein Kampf.

 Atheist: a disbelief in the existence of deity.

 I will be arguing that Hitler was not an atheist, but a theist.
 
 Theist: belief in the existence of a god or gods.

Firstly, Hitler said many things highly indicative of a theist.
 "Besides that, I believe one thing: there is a Lord God! And this Lord God creates the peoples." (Hitler)
 Max Domarus & Patrick Romane. The Essential Hitler: Speeches and Commentary. Bolchazy-Carducci. (2007). P. 499.
 
 "We were convinced that the people need and require this faith. We have therefore undertaken the fight against the atheistic movement, and that not merely with a few theoretical declarations; we have stamped it out" (Hitler)
 Speech in Berlin. October 24, 1933
 
 This next quote is most damning against your argument.
 
 "My feelings as a Christian points me to my Lord and Savior as a fighter. It points me to the man who once in loneliness, surrounded by a few followers, recognized these Jews for what they were and summoned men to fight against them and who, God"s truth! was greatest not as a sufferer but as a fighter. In boundless love as a Christian and as a man I read through the passage which tells us how the Lord at last rose in His might and seized the scourge to drive out of the Temple the brood of vipers and adders. How terrific was His fight for the world against the Jewish poison. To-day, after two thousand years, with deepest emotion I recognize more profoundly than ever before the fact that it was for this that He had to shed His blood upon the Cross. As a Christian I have no duty to allow myself to be cheated, but I have the duty to be a fighter for truth and justice"For as a Christian I have also a duty to my own people." (Hitler)
 Norman H. Baynes. The Speeches of Adolf Hitler. Vol.1. Oxford University Press (1942). pp. 19-20.
 
 The list goes on however there are more than speeches that show that Hitler was a theist. Such as the fact that his soldiers all wore the slogan, "Gott Mit Uns" (God with us) on their belts, that his birthday was "celebrated from the pulpits until his death," as Hitchens so eloquently put it, and another most erie point is that the Nazis published their own slightly revised Christian bible.

 In conclusion...
 I believe it is obvious that Hitler was indeed a theist, and although his thoughts on christianity may have been twisted indeed, does not play a role in this debate. Thus from the facts I have presented Hitler was a theist. I look forward to my opponents response.
