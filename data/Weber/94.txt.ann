TITLE: The Illuminati is a legitimate orginization that continues to influence global politics

CATEGORY: Society

I hate to forfeit this debate, but I have no choice. Life threw me a curveball by the name of Charles Dickens, Little Dorrit. Nice argument. Really well constructed I applaud you, and if you indeed win this debate, so be it. I will be back. Props to my opponent. Once I conquer Dickens, I will be back to conquer you.
