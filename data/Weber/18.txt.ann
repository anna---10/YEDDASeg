TITLE: Marijuana should stay illegal.

CATEGORY: Politics


<<<outside of argumentation>>>
I believe that marijuana should stay illegal. 
<<<aspect1>>>
The reason that I believe in keeping the drug illegal is that it is such a health hazard. If we let weed become legal then we will have many people that have major health problems. Some side effects of this dangerous drug are:
 
 SHORT-TERM EFFECTS
 
 Sensory distortion
 Panic
 Anxiety
 Poor coordination of movement
 Lowered reaction time
 After an initial "up," the user feels sleepy or depressed
 Increased heartbeat (and risk of heart attack)
 
 LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF MARIJUANA
 
 Reduced resistance to common illnesses (colds, bronchitis, etc.)
 Suppression of the immune system
 Growth disorders
 Increase of abnormally structured cells in the body
 Reduction of male sex hormones
 Rapid destruction of lung fibers and lesions (injuries) to the brain could be permanent
 Reduced sexual capacity
 Study difficulties: reduced ability to learn and retain information
 Apathy, drowsiness, lack of motivation
 Personality and mood changes
 Inability to understand things clearly

Also, cannabis can lower your intelligence quotient.
 
 "A study showed that people who started smoking marijuana heavily in their teens and had an ongoing cannabis use disorder lost an average of eight IQ points between ages 13 and 38. The lost mental abilities did not fully return in those who quit marijuana as adults."

 As I hope this has proved to you, the legalization of cannabis would not be a good thing for this world.
