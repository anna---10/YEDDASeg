TITLE: Middle Eastern Terrorists are created by America.

CATEGORY: Politics


<<<outside of argumentation>>>
I"m guessing my opponent is the type of American that is very patriotic, yet unfortunately believes everything that he sees on Fox News. I think he just got angry when he saw my debate post, so hopefully I didn"t offend him so bad that he deregistered his account.
 
 So if he doesn"t respond I"ll just try to give you some information to think about.
 
 
<<<aspect1>>>
In 1988, during the war between Iran and Iraq, the US supported the Iraqi military effort [1] So why would America do that?
 
 When Middle Eastern countries fight and destroy each other, it"s good for the US. It keeps them weak and divided. What"s not good, is when one country scores an overwhelming victory because that is a form of unification.
 
 So America doesn"t love Iraq, but it doesn"t want Iran to have a crushing victory. It"s in America"s interests that the countries keep fighting. Therefore, America backs the losing side so the countries continue to fight and wear themselves down both militarily and economically
