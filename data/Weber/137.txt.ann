TITLE: Time Travel Into the Past Might Be Possible (Not Requiring the Help of God)

CATEGORY: Science

"I can do this. If time travel backwards was possible, we would have time tourists.

They would be everywhere, therefore ruining the space-time continuum, and, as you can see, there are no time tourists. It does NOT read in history books, 'and at the Battle of Lexington, there was the shot heard round the world, in addition to several men in odd clothing with strange devices described similar to video cameras are today.' It just doesn't happen. By the logic of backwards time travel, this means it never will happen."
 How do you know that the time tourists would try to make themselves blatantly obvious? Perhaps they disguise themselves as ordinary people. Perhaps after time travel was discovered, the government banned it due to potential paradoxes, and very few people have actually illegally travelled back in time. Perhaps the time travelers were able to convert themselves into energy in a way that they still had their senses and looked as if they had bodies, but could not actually be seen or heard by people who existed naturally there. In this way, people could record the shot heard round the world without being mentioned in textbooks. And then there's Hawking's theory that once time travel is discovered, we will only be able to travel back to that point, and no point further, because the time machine doesn't exist to travel into. There's also the theory that when you go back in time, you end up in an alternate universe at your desired time, and all events up until that point occur like they had in the original universe, but they start changing in a ripple effect from your arrival, depending on what you do.

To counter all of your theory disapprovals, just because we think something can't be done, doesn't mean that it can't be done. Saying that the atom bomb is different from time travel because the atom bomb has already been constructed doesn't fly. In the 20th century, people started building planes. This didn't show that building a rocket ship was impossible. 
<<<outside of argumentation>>>
And I DO know the method of time travel in "The End of Eternity". A tremendous (but not infinite) amount of energy is put into a generator, which converts that energy into a Temporal Field, which was then put into a time kettle (time machine) which controlled the Temporal Field to move forwards and backwards in time.

Now, since you don't like those theories, here are some more:
 mongeese's Trigger Theory:
 Every time a certain, random, unknown trigger occurs, time is suddenly reversed ten minutes, and the Chaos Theory is applied so that that trigger is not activated again. We do not know what this trigger is because every time it is triggered, we go back in time, and don't remember that ten minutes that passed between the later and then.
 mongeese's Randomness Theory:
 Time randomly goes forwards and reverses. We advance three second, then time undoes half of a second, then we advance for five minutes, then time moves back twenty minutes. We can't prove this, either, because we forget everything that occurred in the time that was undone.
 Passive Theory:
 People can go back in time, but then they don't have the power to alter the events that have already occurred. They are essentially holograms, like Al was in the TV series "Quantum Leap".  http://en.wikipedia.org... 
 Pentagon:
 The Pentagon may have already discovered time travel backwards, for all we know. And they've been using it to undo the countless assassinations of George Bush and Barack Obama.
 
 
<<<aspect4>>>
Also, just because time travel is possible, doesn't mean we have to actually discover how. We may never know, and the solution may be sitting in front of our noses. We don't know.
 
 
<<<conclusion>>>
In conclusion, time travel backwards might be possible.
