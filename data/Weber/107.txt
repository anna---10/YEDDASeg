TITLE: The riches rule over the law

CATEGORY: Society

There have always been a different law for 'haves' and 'have not'. Rich as being the 'haves' and the poor as being the 'have not'. This discrimination leads to a society in which the poor are severely punished for their low riches and the rich enjoy the custody of law in their hands. The poor are thrown into jails for a minor crime. On the other hand the rich are not punished even for the biggest crime. In that way a rule of jungle is observed in the country where only the fittest (the rich) can survive. This sorry state of affairs prevail in every department of the society. The poor are marginalized by the rich forces and every rule and law is established for the
 privilege of the rich class. The 'haves' determine the fate of the have not.
