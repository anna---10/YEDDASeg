TITLE: The US Federal Goveronment should abolish 99%of its functions

CATEGORY: Politics


   
<<<outside of argumentation>>>
First of all my opponent claims that we should abolish the entire government, so from here I only have to argue that education and military spending are necessary. Either way I only claimed that we should abolish all government programs except these, not all government powers aside from these, though this would be a good idea.   
   
<<<aspect1>>>
The necessity of limited government:  
   My opponent claims that we can live without a government because humans automatically recognize immoral behaviors as immoral; therefor we can govern ourselves as individuals. This is not so, James Madison pointed out;  
     “If men were angels no government would be necessary.”    
   But men are not angels, this is fairly obvious, natural law didn’t prevent Muslims from bombing schools or committing atrocities. So someone needs to enforce this law, this is why the government was created.

“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,”    The Declaration of Independence.    
   
<<<aspect2>>>
So the government should preserve our liberties, i.e. life, liberty, and property. Without the government and the second amendment we would all just be victims of whoever came along to victimize us. Say China wants to enslave us, how are we to prevent this but to have a strong national defense and the right to defend our nation ourselves.   
   
<<<aspect3>>>
Then there is the issue of education, how will we ensure that all our children get an education without funding? Where will this funding come from but the government?   
   If we abolish all other functions, as well as slashing the income tax and government spending, and reducing government regulations, as well as providing military spending and an educated public, our economy will experience unprecedented growth and opportunity. Thus these functions should be retained.   
   The case for low taxes and no debt:  
   The government should pay off its debt with all deliberate time, and we don’t need to go into debt to fund education, we can do that with a 7% income tax and no further taxes. Either way there will be consequences to a 21 trillion dollar debt. But like my opponent said what is stopping the government from simply recreating this situation again? That is why I am proposing we pass a constitutional amendment banning government borrowing.   
   We then pass another constitutional amendment banning the government from creating any more powers. It’s that simple,

“The founding fathers had a very good idea of government, they said the government should be very limited, and they should be protecting our liberties, and providing a strong defense and a sound currency, we don’t do any of that.”    – Ron Paul
