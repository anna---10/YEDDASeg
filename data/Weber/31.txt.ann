TITLE: Should the goverment have a national registry of all gun owners in the united states

CATEGORY: Politics


<<<aspect1>>>
First off no my arguement is not flawed! There was one mass shooting in austrilia in 1996 after that government sent letters to the people that there firearms had to be surrendered to law enforcement! There are alot if places around the world like the uk and canada who have utilized regestration to confiscate weapons from the law abiding! Theres no evidence to support that registration needs to be in place therefor why in the world is it the goverments business what the law abiding citizen has! Ive heard numourous reports of politicians wishing they could take all guns away from the general public and registraion will definetly be the first step! Heck even in new york they enacted a gun ban with any gun that can hold more than 5 rounds had to be registered! Later on they had to be turned in or taken out of the city!

Back in the 50s and 60s guns werent regulated you could buy them at a hardware store yet there wasnt a single mass shooting! So what happened. 
<<<outside of argumentation>>>
Registration equals confiscation its worth a google! Look at canada as well
