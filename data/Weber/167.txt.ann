TITLE: The Ancient Astronomy Theory is Correct

CATEGORY: Science


<<<outside of argumentation>>>
I thank my opponent of a speedy response. This is shaping up to be quite a debate!  Before I move on to my rebuttal, I must apologize profusely for being unclear with some of my facts and some of them even being wrong (I was doing it from memory from Erich Von Daniken’s documentary on YouTube). All of those facts will be rectified.    REBUTTALS     
<<<aspect1>>>
C1: THE NAZCA LINES      Simply because we don’t know why the Peruvians would make such lines does not mean that aliens did it.     Forgive me for being unclear, I am not suggesting that aliens created the lines, I am suggesting that the ancient Peruvians built the lines FOR the aliens. Please explain then why these patterns can ONLY be seen from the sky and why they would smooth down the tops of the surrounding hills to form runways?     Furthermore, the “alien runway” hypothesis doesn’t actually explain anything. Why make a run-way in the shape of a monkey?     I am deeply sorry for not being clear. The monkey was actually only one of many designs that were made in the earth, not the actual runways. 
<<<outside of argumentation>>>
I had a picture of the runways, but it wouldn’t upload as I explained in the comments. It still refuses to upload so the picture can be found in SOURCE 2. 
<<<aspect1>>>
The monkey was only one of 70 animal designs [1]. It is speculated that these designs guided the aliens to the runways [3].     Does Pro really expect us to believe that advanced inter-galactic alien aircrafts required 6 – 15+ times the amount of runway space as our aircrafts?     We have differing facts on this, the largest of the designs measured over 660 feet across which is nowhere near a mile [1]. Furthermore, I am not here to tell you why these crafts required more runway (though your facts may be incorrect), I’m here to tell you that these aliens exist, so this is rather irrelevant.     It is true that there is no rubble underneath the Nazca lines, but we wouldn’t expect there to be any because the Nazca lines are NOT located on top of a mountain.     My point was misinterpreted, the Nazca lines isn’t the runway. The rubble I was talking about was referring to the runways which are located on mountains nearby. Just looking at the picture (SOURCE 2, sorry for the inconvenience), it is clear that one mountain’s top has been smoothed off to create what resembles a runway. Looking at the nearby mountains, they still have their tops. Where did the smoothed rubble from the top of the mountains go? Nothing just disappears.    The refutation to my point has been refuted, the Nazca Line Point still stands.

C2: THE PYRAMIDS OF GIZA AND TEOTIHUACAN      The Prime Meridian is an imaginary line created in 1884, almost 4.5 thousand years after TGPOG was built.     My mistake, this was a fact error on my part. I was thinking of the most famous latitude/longitude lines. TGPOG doesn’t go through the equator and prime meridian, but rather           Anyone with the ability to notice that the sun rises in the East and sets in the West can line up an object with the cardinals.     The Egyptians knew about true north [1]? Unlikely.     It took 20 years, but this isn’t unreasonable as I will show.     This has not been shown, I invite my opponent to tell us about how ancient humans dragged millions of ton-block stones up mile long ramps, fitted them so perfectly a knife can’t go between them, and did all the ornate marble works within the pyramid in ONLY 20 years.     85% if the pyramids stones were made of soft stand-stone which was cut on site. The larget stones were dug out of the ground, lifted with levers onto a sled, dragged to a boad, and shipped via the Nile.     Once again our facts differ. The Pyramid of Giza was composed of roughly 2.3 million limestone blocks which came from nearby quarries, not cut on site. The largest stone weighed 25 – 80 tonnes and was transported to TGPOG from Aswan, which was 500 miles away. It is believed that 5.5 million tonnes of limestone, 8000 tonnes of granite (all coming from Aswan) and 500 000 tons of mortar were used in the construction of TGPOG. [4] All of this between 10-20 years? And I’ve only touched on the major issues, I haven’t even mentioned that the Egyptians somehow got the perimeter to height ration to be almost EXACTLY 2pi.     Furthermore, most of the worlds major pyramids have very similar perimeters.     This isn’t spectacular? These cultures have never contacted each other, but somehow their structures are the same perimeter? Possibly the aliens gave this pyramid building knowledge to these civilizations.     Your picture has been doctored to make it look like the pyramids line up in a significant way, when really all you’ve done is draw a line through the pyramids and claimed they line up the same way. You can do that with literally any 2 objects if you pay no attention to distance.     Well I click on the link, it just brings me to Google maps. Could you please elaborate on how you came up with these numbers?     Which ones? And how is that possible given that where the other planets are located relative to the Earth constantly changes given that each planet is in constant motion along several axises?     My mistake, this was an incorrect fact from the Ancient Astronomy Theory YouTube Videos, parts 1- 9. However, many of the degree of alignments in Teotihuacan in general line up to 15.5 degrees. [4] The city is 15.5 degrees off from the cardinal directions. The Street of the Dead funs from 15.5 degrees east of north to 15.5 degrees west of south. The pyramid of the sun is 15.5 degrees north of west, need I go on? This 15.5 degree alignment puts the Pyramid of the Sun and Moon in line with the Sun on August 13 th . [4]    My arguments regarding the two pyramids still stand.

C3: REFERENCES IN WRITING      No source. I can’t verify or falsify this yet.     The Book of Ezekiel, Bible, Chapter 1.     This image does not resemble modern space ships at all, but even if it did, wouldn’t alien ships look much more advanced than our own?     Assumption. The ergonomics of the spaceship don’t matter, the Mayans were not all Leonardo Da Vinci, this was the best they could interpret it. Pacal is clearly bending forward, oxygen tubes are in his nose, his hands are manipulating controls, his feet are pushing pedals, he is sitting on some sort of chair, and there are flames coming from the exhaust. My opponent is making the mistake of assuming alien ships look like ours.     They could fly, but they flew via flying horse-drawn chariots     I’m sorry, but the Vimanas were the actual machines. “The Ramayana even describes a beautiful chariot which arrived “shining, a wonderful divine CAR that sped through the air””.

 [5]. Where are horses mentioned? This should like a UFO to me.     This is a point that pro forgot to add his citation for, so I’ll hold off on this one until next round as well.   
 
     Sorry for forgetting the source. It has been added as SOURCE 6.    CONCLUSION    All of Con’s points can be disproven using simple logic and facts. It is clear that all my points still stand, so it is an easy vote PRO.
