TITLE: Does Gun Control Make Society Safer?

CATEGORY: Society

"I am not proposing a complete ban on guns - it is perfectly within the right of citizens to keep guns in their house if it makes them feel safer."
 Well, you may not, but that doesn't mean others do not. And that's not even the point; 
<<<aspect1>>>
the point I was trying to make was that the government isn't as good at keeping things off the streets as it thinks it is. So if the government thinks it can keep arms off the streets, it cannot.

 "There are less than 200 homicides a year in Canada. There are over 10,000 in the US."
 Well, you should keep in mind that Canada has a mere 35 million people. That's less than the population of California, and barely a tenth of our total population, so clearly statistics cannot be compared this way. Yes, I am aware that even when you adjust for population, their homicide rate is lower. But whether or not their gun control is the cause remains to be seen. There are nations with strict gun laws who have low crime rates (Japan, South Korea) and there are nations with strict gun laws and high crime rates (Honduras, Mexico). So clearly gun control itself is not the answer. All things equal, I'd rather have a gun.

"But did anyone ever stop to think that, in the 1700s, there were no semi-automatic weapons."
 A common misconception. You see, the constitution is what's referred to as "a living document", meaning that it can change with the times. So, even though guns have advanced since the days of the second amendment's ratification, the message does not. This would be just like arguing that the 1st amendment's protection of freedom of the press only applied to newspapers because TV news stations and news websites did not exist back then.
