The Quran encourages people to defend themselves
 The only problem with you people is that you tend to link terrorism with Islam and make it seem like terrorism is what defines Islam.
 What is the actual meaning of terrorism? It is the unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims, according to Google. Where does it say religion? It says POLITICAL AIMS.
 And seriously what about other terrorist groups huh? The white supremacists that attacked the USA and they were responsible for 115 incidents. What about in Burma and India where thousands of innocent Muslims and young children have been killed?
 So clearly Islam is not linked to terrorism
 Go do your research lil boy
 And seriously you're not providing info,
