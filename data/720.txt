TITLE: Jews control America

CATEGORY: Politics

While the top 1% does have a lot of influence in America, there are many movements in the United States that are not influenced by the top 1%. An example is the Occupy Wall Street(OWS) movement, which hates the 1% being rich by making Iphones used by OWS. Not all people in the top 1% are CEOs. My dad is in the top 1% and he does not make decisions on who to go to war with, who to teach your kids at school and how many women you should be hired in his company. Also on the last example, the average CEO wants employees who are skilled in their job. The congressmen in office are those who had the most votes in their state/district for the position.
 
 Not all congressmen vote for whoever their financial bankers (FB) want them too. If your FB supports Trump over Hillary, then there will be many of his employees that support Trump, and there would be many people who support Hillary, and the FB doesn't care on the ideology of his employees. He cares about how much profit they can generate for the company. This FB would rather hire a productive Clinton supporter than a non productive Trump supporter since they want profit.
 
 I can't access the YouTube link since it's blocked on my device. However, the reason why The US helps out Israel is because a consistent solid majority of Americans support Israel, even around 50% of Democrats, who tend to be more pro Palestine ideology and they want a 2 state solution ( http://www.pewresearch.org... )( http://israel-vs-palestine.com... )( http://news.gallup.com... ).
 
 Trump's biggest donor (BD) was a Jew yes. However, was Hillary Clinton's BD Jewish? Cruz's BD? Bernie Sander's BD? He's Jewish, so he may have attracted more Jewish supporters, but was his biggest BD Jewish? John Kasichs BD?
 
 If all of them didn't have a Jew as their BD, then Jews make up about 25% of the top 1% and 20% of the BDs.
