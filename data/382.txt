TITLE: President Elected by Congress, not by the people

CATEGORY: Politics

I know that this goes against what our founding fathers believe in, but I see no real harm done.. It is my opinion that American's vote for their Representatives and Senators for their political positions, say con abortion, then why shouldn't their Representatives and Senators be able to elect a President that is also against abortion themselves? Also having Congress elect the President would pretty much put an end to legislation blocking done by the president. An example being if we have a Republican Congress and a Democratic President, if Congress passes a law restricting the use of birth control the democratic President is going to block the legislation because of his political stance. But if Congress would elect the President, then we would have a Republican Congress and a Republican President, meaning that the law restricting birth control would get passed and not blocked. This system works out in countries like Britain and Japan. And again my major argument, that we would be electing our officials who would be electing our President, so in sense we would be electing out President inadvertently.
