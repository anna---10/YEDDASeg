TITLE: Obama should declair a state of emergency because of climate change

CATEGORY: Politics

1. The president has the power in a state of emergency. If it has to be a war, OK let's declare war on god.
 
 2. I guess you missed the part about having a solar panel on every roof.
 
 3. I never mentioned wind. The cost of solar will go down, once it's in mainstream use. Who cares about a "tab", when the whole world is at stake? When we go to war, does anybody ask "who will pick up the tab"? 
 
 4. Leaf is a toy. I'm talking about technology used my Tesla Motors (I guess you didn't click on my link).
 0-60 in 4 seconds, 300 miles per charge, swappable batteries in case of emergency, etc.
  
 
 We have the technology to stop global warming. It's crazy not to do it because of a "tab" or denial of the technology.
 
 That's like saying it costs too much to join a gym. I'd rather risk getting a heart attack. 
 
 What you pay now to prevent a catastrophe, will be worth 1 million times its weight when it comes to paying for the catastrophe after it happens!
