TITLE: Community Service

CATEGORY: Society

Forcing students to do service is still bad. I think it is a form of indentured servitude, even though the people may receive a paycheck. It also takes away the idea of the United States being a free place to live. The federal government considers funding for the "faith-based programs", but who really determines which programs would qualify?
 
 I know there are many students out there who do work, but not voluntarily. They need to be paid to help support their families or to save for college. It would be unfair to force them to do community service.
