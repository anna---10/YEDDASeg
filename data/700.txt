TITLE: Can socialism work?

CATEGORY: Politics

People point to examples like Nazi Germany and the USSR and use those as examples as to why Socialism can't work but they're wrong about those two examples. Nazi Germany and the USSR were Fascist nations. There is pretty consistent agreement on that in the history books. There are countries now that have a pretty strong Socialist government, for example those in the Scandinavian regions in the world and they seem to hold the case that Socialism can work. Even though those countries are doing it well they tend to be ignored by the media and in turn by the public because they're too lazy or whatever to do their own research about things.
