TITLE: Gun control

CATEGORY: Politics

First my opponent said that people who want guns will simply steel guns on the black market. So basically what you're saying if people are going to break a law why have that law? Does this apply to murder too? People break that law any way, A lot of times with gun, with no regulations on them.
  http://usatoday30.usatoday.com... . There is the source for the 40% of felons go back to prison, but thats not my point. My real point is if you're felon you need to pay the price for your actions for the rest of your life. You also shouldn't have a gun because you're still a risk to society because we know you have the ability to commit a bad crime.
 
 You also said that Norway has the lowest crime rate in Western Europe but Norway also has an assault weapon ban and also you must go through a test to obtain another type of gun.  http://en.wikipedia.org... . I got the source that time for you.
 
 You said the government shouldn't be able regulate guns because it would give the government too much power, I agree that the government should have less power than it does right now, but I still think they should have the power over gun regulations. They should because one of their jobs is to protect its citizens and they should be doing that by taking the guns away from the crazy people we have in our country.
