TITLE: The U.S. Federal Government should increase its exploration and/or development of space

CATEGORY: Science

*My first debate here so bare with me*
 
 I would like to pose several questions for my opponent:
 
 - Would you go so far as to say the U.S should do away with space exploration and never consider it again?
 
 - Are you debating against the idea of space exploration/research as a whole(As in all the nations) or just the United States' involvement with the endeavor? By this I mean are you saying that the U.S. should cease to ever get involved or "step up" it's participation in extrasolar exploration?
 
 My opening thoughts and comments:
 
 - Should the U.S allow other nations to surpass it in this field?
 
 - Isn't the technology and knowledge acquired worth the costs?
 
 I think space exploration is the next logical step in the human endeavor. We are an exploratory species with philosophical differences that have been getting slightly better over the centuries with some low points and high points. The trials of a space program unite and inspire not just a country, but the entire world. Science done in space and potentially other worlds could lead to wonderful technologies that could improve the lives of people on Earth, and the overall condition of the planet.
