TITLE: Should we reduce taxes in the United States?

CATEGORY: Society

Good Day.
 This debate is going to me over the topic of rather we should reduce taxes or not.
 Clearly, we should not.
 Firstly, let us take a look at the national debt of the United States. If we were to reduce taxes, the debt would go up. Imagine this situation. You work for a business. The United States federal government comes up to you and buys a lot of things from you. Then, they decide not to pay you back and just add it on to their heap of debt. Not fun right? Just look at this quote from this article.
 
 "On November 7, 2016, debt held by the public was $14.3 trillion or about 76% of the previous 12 months of GDP.[5][6][7][8] Intragovernmental holdings stood at $5.4 trillion, giving a combined total gross national debt of $19.8 trillion or about 106% of the previous 12 months of GDP.[7] $6.2 trillion or approximately 45% of the debt held by the public was owned by foreign investors, the largest of which were China and Japan at about $1.25 trillion for China and $1.15 trillion for Japan as of May 2016.[9]"
 The article can be found here:  https://en.wikipedia.org... 
 
 Why should be make our debt go up when we already owe 19 trillion dollars to people?
 
 Next, let us imagine a world without any public services. Someone stabs another person. There will be no police force to arrest them. Then, there would be no hospital for the stabbed person to go. You see where this is going? Taxes are what fund public services, and without them, society would be a complete disaster.
 
 There are many more reasons why less taxes would't work, but I don't need to go over them right now.
