TITLE: The Confederate flag always represents racism.

CATEGORY: Politics

The Confederacy openly accepted and supported slave owners. This means a symbol that represents the Confederacy also represents the Confederacy's values.
 
 Each Declaration of Cause from the Confederate states says that the defense of slavery is a clear objective, as well as makes attacks on anti-slavery.
 
 However it can be argued that states rights is the main cause of the secession. I do not believe it. But it is possible for an organization to have more than one principle. The Confederacy can stand for both States rights and slavery. Just because the main reason was states rights doesn't make eclipse the fact that they enslaved black people.
 
 No matter how you slice it, an organization that openly supports the institutional enslavement and oppression of people based on race is racist. Any representation of this organization is representing that racism that the organization stood for.
