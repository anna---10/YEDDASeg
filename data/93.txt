TITLE: The United States of America is a Christian nation.

CATEGORY: Politics

"In god we trust" appears on all of our Currency.
 
 "One nation under god"
 
 We swear on a holy bible when we give testimony in court.
 
 Yet our nation was founded on the notion of being able to practice ANY religion.
 
 So someone prove to me that we are a Christian nation. Not in terms of the majority of what people believe (many people believing one thing doesn't make it true)
 
 So, convince me.
