TITLE: We should not ban guns.

CATEGORY: Politics

I do agree that if guns aren't banned completely, then way stricter rules. I also agree that people can get them illegally anyway. Though, they can be used for self-protection, they are also used for harm. I have had 4 family members shoot themselves because they were feeling depressed, and the gun was there. I know it's like that for a lot of other people and their family members, too. Having guns (in my opinion) makes people feel a false sense of power, and things could go wrong fast. I am not completely con, nor am I pro. At first I thought this was a joke post, but then you gave actual reason. I do understand and respect your points, they were very much valid. We are in a world of tough times (emotionally) and if guns are provided, there's no telling what a depressed or angry person might do in the moment. I do believe people should take courses and safety lessons before even being able to buy or apply for a gun / gun licence. It would be much safer.
