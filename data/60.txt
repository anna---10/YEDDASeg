CATEGORY: Politics

Abortions might cost $500 for a women, but $500 is nothing compared to the amount of money than raising a child requires. On average, it takes $245,000 to raise a kid, that's 490 times the amount of money it takes to have an abortion. Women prefer to pay $500 or $700 and wait until they have enough money to support their child, rather than have a baby that it going to take a lot of money from them plus the time and energy that they need. Abortions are good because they decrease the rate of teenage pregnancy which is basically children taking care of children. Abortions also allow women to make their own choices. About 13,000 women have abortions each year because they were raped or incest. 50% of women who have abortions report that they used some type of birth control before they had sex with their partner because their plan was never to have a baby but things went wrong and the women ended up pregnant. They were well aware that it wasn't the perfect time for them to have a baby. Also, in a survey completed by women who had abortions, most women reported to be stressed out before they had the abortion rather than after they had it so having an abortion was the right thing for them to do because stress can lead to Pain of any kind, Heart disease, Digestive problems, Sleep problems, Depression, Weight problems, Auto immune diseases, Skin conditions, such as eczema, etc.
