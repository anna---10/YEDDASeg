TITLE: Lowering the voting age to 16

CATEGORY: Politics

Adults have forever messed up the country, so what would be the harm in allowing sixteen and seventeen year olds to also vote?
 Under the law of eighteen and older that we currently have, minors who are intelligent enough to monitor an election and unbiasedly elect a canidate are forced under the leadership of the biased and politically uneducated voting of adults.
 This is not fair.
 Lowering the voting age to sixteen would allow teens a fair chance at really deciding their future.
