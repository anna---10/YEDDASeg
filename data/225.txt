TITLE: parental ambition causes increase in pressure on children

CATEGORY: Society

Though parental pressure is a part of the problem, it is in no way the cause.
 
 There are a lot of things in this equation, increased homework being another, and hormones. But I would argue there is one factor that is the main problem and the cause of many of the others: Society's pressure.
 
 There was a time where school was a privilege, or just not a big deal. School was secondary in life, but not now. High school dropouts are seen as a problem for a reason even though for most of history no one cared. People aren't hiring people without education now, school is seen as the only path in life instead of helpful.
 
 This turns school from a safe place to experiment with life and learn, to a place if you fail you will end up in the lowest position is society. This attitude makes failing in school at all seem hopeless, which causes parents to act that way along with almost everyone else.
 
 It doesn't help that people constantly tell students that it just gets harder. That gets rid of hope, they are thrown to the sharks and if they survive they will live in the snake pit.
