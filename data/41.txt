TITLE: Teenagers, Theft, And Corporal Punishment

CATEGORY: Society

In our story today a pastor catches two boys ages 13 and 15 stealing from the collection plate. The boys' father pleads with the pastor not to report the incident to the police and each boy will get a whipping when they get home. The pastor tells the father whipping the boys isn't a good idea and he'll be contacting the police
 
 The father stomped out of the pastors office, grabbed the boys, went home and administered the whippings. Meanwhile the pastor contacted the sheriff's office and reported the theft.
 
 Did the pastor do and say the right things? I say he did and will take that side
