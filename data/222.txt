TITLE: The philippines should continue the "Kill on sight if armed" law against criminals.

CATEGORY: Politics

Alright, fair point. I agree with police abusing their power, there a plenty of cases where that happened for the past year or so. But it rarely does, I think the reason for that is, they're somewhat scared. You see there used to be more police brutality when the previous president is still sitting, but when the current one got elected, it slowly decreases since I don't think duterte will take kindly of that, seeing as there are numerous cases, almost everyday actually about drug users and dealers getting killed on the streets by unknown men, they're presumed to be vigilantes sent by him but I'm not sure about this yet.
 
 Anyways, I strongly agree about the abusing of power part, a police can literally just shoot someone unarmed (Accidentally or not) then plant a gun like nothing happened and state that the suspect tried to fight, the main contradictory problem here is that nothing can be done about it, I mean granted the government can probably implement a system where every police officers on raiding must wear a portable camera to avoid these type of mischievous acts but even then these scenarios rarely happens here, criminals really still do try to fight back and police men risk their lives everyday.
 
 Nonetheless, countless previous presidents tried numerous and various ways to counteract crimes without resorting to violence like free rehabilitation for drug users (Drug users volunteer to be cured on their own volition surprisingly) yet none of them were effective to purge clean or at least reduce the crime rate, in the case of the rehabilitation a quarter still used drugs or even more, granted the rest might have really changed but you have to understand that illegal medicine spread quickly and efficiently area to area, people do these illegal act to forget about their painful lives, even for a moment, which is not all that surprising seeing how poor our economy is.
