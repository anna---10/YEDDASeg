TITLE: volunteer fire services should be harassed by news crews about money they have used

CATEGORY: Society

I was unable to finish my typing due to a malfunction on my device. Before I make another argument I would like to finish. Luxurious things like pool tables and Xboxs at home. Do you know that millions of dollars are spent on troops being entertained overseas? That includes battle ready rounds, rockets, and grenades just so they can have fun. There is money specifically set for buying ammunition that is used for fun and a different set of money used for training and battle. Or at least we pay for enough rounds so that they can be entertained. Does this bother you?
 (Now my next argument)
 People are putting their lives on the lines, and deserve to get entertained. Even if they are there for a few hours or overnight, every little stress relief with their 'brothers and sisters' helps them out. It is definitely worth it and fair. The individuals are not paid in money, which is why get the title volunteer.
