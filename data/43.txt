TITLE: National Health Care

CATEGORY: Politics

Thanks to my opponent for a great debate with many good ideas. Now onto my conclusion.
 
 In conclusion, socialized medicine, by means of the government providing health care to all is a major threat to our country. National health care drives out doctors, encourages unhealthy lifestyles, and endangers the lives of those who need it most.
 
 In addition, national health care will only further increase our never-ending debt, driving us further and further down a road we are not prepared for.
 
 It may seem easy to readily compare France and the United States about how much each spends on health care and the amount of satisfaction, but the truth is our health care system can not easily be compared to that of many socialized countries, such as France, because the population difference is so great.
 
 Finally, I believe that national health care is just one more step towards socialism and away from capitalism. Capitalism is the very way we run our country and is what allows us to remain the worlds best economy, and runs on the idea that you must work hard to get what you want, and have things provided to you by the government.
 
 Once again, thanks to my opponent for a great debate.
