TITLE: Do we need doctors?

CATEGORY: Science

"we need to lower the world population" Really?! so who do you plan to kill, and what do you mean by saying that humans shouldn't be eating grain....Really....Really.... and how does grain cause overpopulation, oh and if people stop eating grain, sugar, dairy, fat than people will starve and all the "good foods" prices will skyrocket so even more people will starve and if people starve than they can't work so jobs close and workers are in high demand so jobs such as energy will be close to ending, so no electricity and with no electricity than farmers can't make as much "good food" so even more people starve meaning less workers so society as a whole would stop and humanity will collapse.
