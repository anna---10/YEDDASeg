<<<aspect1>>> spending and saving
<<<aspect2>>> businesses

<<<outside of argumentation>>>
Hello, superkamal26,  
   Nope my argument still stands. My point was never a pure calling for higher taxes but to show that an optimum point exists that it may be higher than the current level. It appears that you reused your stating premise, thus allow me to deconstruct it and rebut point by point.  
<<<aspect1>>>
     3.0 “  higher taxes … people will spend less money and save more”     
<<<aspect1>>>
   3. 1 Assuming that we are talking about income tax, higher taxes do not encourage people to save. Instead, people would still spend according to the elasticity of the goods. In fact the reverse is true. Having less capital to spend, people would not be able to afford to save if they wish to maintain their current standard of living.  
<<<aspect2>>>
    4.0 “When businesses make a lot of money … better it is for the economy.”   
<<<aspect2>>>
   4.1 It is debatable that businesses would choose to reinvest back to the economy especially if there is an on-going financial crisis. Instead, businesses might want to build a hedge fund or worst, funnel their resources overseas.   
<<<aspect2>>>
   4.2 You also assess that businesses create jobs.  This might be true in the States. However, in some countries, the government is the main employer of jobs. This means in the short term, these workers would suffer a decrease in wages, this would lead to less consumer spending and, in the long term, lesser revenue for businesses.
