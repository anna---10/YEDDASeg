TITLE: Humans are natural monsters---We need to fear ourselves

CATEGORY: Society

I am arguing that monsters are only through a misunderstanding of other cultures, that the more we understand the further it appears that monsters turn on out to be that, and that naturally in a species like ours. Where communication and working together is natural, that eventually with time, we will see this idea of monster fade away. I would also state that humans are naturally caring. It is in their interest to be protective, but also there is an empathy and sympathy in this species that others don't possess to this extent. Do we have, as humans have a few bad eggs? Yes, but I feel that if your statement was correct, than we would have many more wars than today. Despite the fact that we have 7 billion people, weapons capable of doing mass damage and evil, and so many culture/beliefs/ideologies, living so close to each other that don't just immediately run and attack the others... well, that also gives one a good reference point to see that humans aren't monsters. Don't get my wrong, I'm not an overly optimistic, blind to world events, random peace loving computer hippy. ( Just decided to make that phrase up) However, we have seen it time and time again, cultures which may have done horrible things to each other are eventually getting overrun by the human instinct to work together, if there is a monster in all of this, it isn't humans, it is more likely ideas and values that get passed down either thru religion, or a few very extreme governments with insane influence.
