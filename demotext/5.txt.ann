TITLE: Prior to an abortion on a pregnant minor, a parent/guardians must be notified and give consent*.

CATEGORY: Society

<<<aspect1>>>
"The strong (AKA Parents) have a moral obligation to protect the weak (Minors)."
 
<<<outside of argumentation>>>
 What sort of morality is this, which declares the purpose of man is to be a slave, not to something greater, but to whoever comes along who is LESS then themself? What corruption of standards allows you to declare, as another being's claim upon my actions, not their GOOD qualities, what they will trade for it- but the fact that they are an incompetent? Morality is supposed to be a science by which one deduces the principles from which actions can be said to enhance their lives. Yet let us look at the consequences of your view. If everyone who is "Strong" sacrifices themself in the name of whoever is "Weak," what occurs down this road? Obviously, everyone and everything worthwhile dies, and everyone is weak. So the least weak among the weak sacrifice themself to the most weak-the dead. Death is the purpose and standard of that disgusting thing you call your "Morality." It is the ultimate goal toward which you clearly strive- the death of all. No other consequence can come from consistent application of the "principle" you have just advocated.
 
 "So if a 10 yr old wants to play in the street, the parents can ask for him to come in but if he chooses not to then the parent is to do nothing? If he gets hit by a car then?????"
 Then justice has occurred. The child took an action, and received the rightful consequences.
 
 "
 What about the kid who would rather stay home with Mommy at age 5 then go to kindergarden? Should be â€˜forced' to go?
 "
 No. He may be forced out of the home if he refuses- the home is not his, entering it on any but the owner's terms is trespassing- but he cannot be rightfully forced to go a specific place for any reason but to put a stop to such trespass.
 
<<<aspect2>>>
 "However, making the decision to Marry, join the army, Have or not have a child, to vote on your governmental leaders, these are life's biggest decisions and a 15 yr old is just not wise nor educated enough to have the freedoms to make these decisions on their own."
<<<aspect2>>>
 First, not all 15 year olds are the same. Second, if they are wise enough, you are wrong, and if they aren't, you are still wrong, because you are impeding justice- you are attempting to shield them from the consequences of their actions.
 
 "
<<<aspect2>>>
 The reason for the age barriers is not to enslave a group of people but to protect them from themselves."
<<<outside of argumentation>>>
 To "Protect" someone from "Themself" is a contradiction. Protection refers to preventing outside things from negatively affecting x. And it does not change the fact of slavery.
 
<<<aspect2>>>
 "Some of those ill conceived decisions can not be undone."
<<<outside of argumentation>>>
 The ill-conceived decision to rob a human being of several years of their life can never be undone.
 
 "
 Every culture on the word speaks to this, including religious texts,"
 Ad authoritatem.
 
 And a disgusting ad authoritatem, the Qu'ran (Kill disbelievers wherever you find them. If they attack you, then kill them. Such is the reward of disbelievers. (But if they desist in their unbelief, then don't kill them.) 2:191-2
 
 Have no unbelieving friends. Kill the unbelievers wherever you find them. 4:89
 
 If the unbelievers do not offer you peace, kill them wherever you find them. Against such you are given clear warrant. 4:91
 
 Fight disbelievers who are near you, and let them see the harshness in you. 9:123)
 
 and the Bible (
 "Thou Shalt not suffer a witch to live." Exodus 22:18
 
 And Moses was wroth with the officers ... And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive? ... Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him. But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves. Numbers 31:1-18)
 
 are clearly among the WORST places to pull an ad authoritatem on morality from that you could possibly find!
 
<<<aspect1>>>
 "
 Not honoring parents also causes immaturity."
<<<outside of argumentation>>>
 This is absurd. Mature people are far less likely than immature people to honor their parents. Just ask any toddler what they think of their parents, when they aren't throwing a tantrum ("I love mommy and daddy!").
 
<<<aspect1>>>
 "Because children do not respect their parents' advice, they grow up missing the significance of much they encounter, and so wisdom comes to them very slowly. In some cases, they may never learn wisdom."
<<<outside of argumentation>>>
 Load of nonsense. Blind obedience to another's statement is the opposite of wisdom.
 
 Now, is it possible you could maybe make some arguments based on THIS WORLD, rather than the imaginary world the authors of the Bible and the Qu'ran wrote about?
